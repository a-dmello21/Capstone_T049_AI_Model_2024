"It's interesting that you raise this because when we started doing like the beta program for Retail Media Planner, I started asking like TAM’s [Technical Account Managers] and CSM's [Customer Success Managers] what the Fill Rates were expected to be because the data we imported. I was like, this is really low. Surely this isn't right?",Retailer Media Planner (AdManager), Fill Rates, Managed service,,,,,,,,,,,
And no one really knew the answer. Which I found a bit strange because I would have thought that would be like a key metric that we would be tracking like from a CSM’s point of view.,Managed service, Value or belief,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And maybe it is like call it something else or you know, we sort of track it in a different way. But no one really knew exactly what the percentage Fill Rate – like a retailer would be wanting or what their existing ones were. The clients that we have in the RMP tool now with that data we have calculated Fill Rates and that's sort of ranges from – and I can quickly check now but and the data is a little bit out of date, but it would give some idea – the managed service clients had the best Fill Rates. Which I suppose makes sense. That's what you know, it shows that the managed service team are doing, you know what they should be and what they can't be doing to improve those Fill Rates.",Performance, Managed service, Retailers, Fill Rates, Retailer Media Planner (AdManager),,,,,,,,,
"Like I just checked Drizzly there and as I said the data is out of date but Drizzly there the total Sell-Through [rate] from the data that we had is only 3%. If I look at Shipt, it is like 2%. And again, this is tricky because it's out of date like a lot of this data was imported back in June [2023]. But from memory, the managed service ones were sitting at about 30% Sell-Through rate around that sort of level. And then the others that we'd imported were sitting around sort of between 5 and 10%. And that's why I was sort of questioning if the data I had was correct because to me that seems really, really low. And that's why I sort of set a questioning, you know, is this right? Do we know what the client Fill Rates are?",Shipt, Drizzly, Value or belief, Managed service, Sell-Through Rate, Understanding vague,,,,,,,,
"And no one, no one seemed to know [the Fill Rate metric]. But then also no one seemed to be concerned by like 10%, which also surprised me. So it made it made the success metrics for RMP tricky because they didn't know if they were really accurate, if that makes sense.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Sorry Mike, what is it [data] that’s imported. I know managed services side is higher is 30%. What is the imported [data]? Is it the self-service.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So we import all the data – so if I just share my screen for a second – like we import the data for any of these clients using RMP [shared RMP dashboard on-screen]. So as I said, this was imported from like probably June, July. Possibly even earlier. But we're getting the total impression capacity for all of their search terms and categories that are relevant. Then we're looking at how many of those are filled. And we're classing filled as being either a fixed tenancy booking or an auction booking. And then we're just dividing the two to get like a Sell-Through or a Fill Rate.",Retailer Media Planner (AdManager), Fill Rates, Sell-Through Rate, Data, Auctions, FTA (Fixed Tenancy Ads), Impressions, Search terms / Keywords, Categories,,,,,
"Where currently making changes, like part of this integration with campaign that we're doing in retail for RMP. That is bringing in more data to the RMP module that will probably make this a little bit more accurate, as currently we're not taking into account things like placements and slots. And we're not considering that a particular placement is auction only or fixed tenancy only.",Retailer Media Planner (AdManager), Campaign Manager (AdManager), Integrations, Limitation, Placements,,,,,,,,,
"So I believe in that calculations we might be counting that as, like it might be double counted for example, or it might be counted, but it shouldn't be. So probably these things will change. But that's how we're currently calculating it in all of the data’s from core dataset and insights. And, that's sort of what we're what we're getting at the moment. I'm trying to think who the best example would be.",Data challenge, Data, Insights,,,,,,,,,,,
"I mean, most of them the data is pretty… like the levels are pretty low for that Sell-Through. And it doesn't help that it's old data. But even when it was brand new data, it was still pretty low. This is Big Basket [shared dashboard on screen]. Oh, apparently this doesn't even have any data, so it's good. Maybe just in banner? There's nothing! I don't know if that helps in any way. I was sort of starting to go down the same path that you looks like you're going down now Ollie, and trying to work this out.",Data, Big Basket, Sell-Through Rate, Banners,,,,,,,,,,
"And we have like we do have that data as well. So like, again, let me find more that's actually got some data that's worth looking at. So again, like this is from I think we imported this stuff in April or something like that. It's a bit out of date. But we do break it down on like a per keyword level, so we can see like the Sell-Through rate. So this was around Easter [2023] for example. So we can say like chocolate at that time was a 10% Fill Rate. Compared to coffee was a 2% for example. And then like the top monetised one [search term], so we can see here like mouthwash for some reason was at 25% in that time.",Sell-Through Rate, Data, Fill Rates, Search terms / Keywords,,,,,,,,,,
"And then, obviously there's some large impression cap like capacity differences [between the search terms on the monetised dashboard table]. So we do break it down to that level. In terms of like deep diving, Big Basket were the most open to questioning the figures. And actually, saying like ""Oh, this doesn't seem right compared to the data that we have"". So I actually had some feedback from them [Big Basket]. See if I can quickly find it [in SharePoint]. Of course we need to do the steps signing while I'm doing that. They actually did a bit of a deep dive themselves into the Fill Rates. And they were saying it didn't seem to match up with what they expected. And they were wondering if potentially we were putting like an additional multiplier onto our total impressions.",Big Basket, Understanding vague, Fill Rates, Impressions, Follow-up, Analysis,,,,,,,,
"For example, it might be, so here [in the beta feedback spreadsheet in SharePoint] we had their number of total number of impressions for biscuits as 85 million for a year. Whereas they knew that it was only about 400,000 [impressions] per month which is about 5 million. So that's like a massive multiplier difference. Said they were questioning sort of how we came to that 85 million number.",Retailer Media Planner (AdManager), Understanding vague, Impressions,,,,,,,,,,,
"So if you want a specific retailer to reach out to, that will be useful, I definitely recommend Big Basket because they seem to be quite switched on with those figures and things like that. I think it was Ganesh that I was dealing with. All of the others, like even during the initial onboarding to the beta running demos; having them in the platform and actually using it. No one ever really raised questions around ""Is this data right? This feel right seems really low"". Which is surprising.",Retailers, On-boarding, Retailer Media Planner (AdManager), Big Basket, Data, Understanding vague,,,,,,,,
Possibly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yeah, possibly. I mean, obviously we explain to them what it is, but you know it can get lost in translation, so to speak. So there is that potential – the difference between like terminology of Sell-Through versus Fill Rate. And potentially we need to look at renaming it in RMP as well.",Sell-Through Rate, Fill Rates, UI improvement, Language use / Terminology,,,,,,,,,,
"I want to ask some basic [questions]. So we know the Fill Rate is the one we show divided by the one we send, right? So we can send 100 [Ads], but we only show they only show impression for 5. So that's 5%. Am I right? That's the first. OK.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So the way we're calculating it in RMP is the total number of impressions that are filled against the total number of available impressions. In RMP we aren't considering like the 100 Ads that may be requested and only five get shown. All we are looking at is the number of actual placements that exist that can actually have an Ad. So if they [the retailer] only have like 5 banner and 5 sponsored products, even if they were requested 100, we are only classing it as them having 10 total [placement spots]. And that's how we calculating the impression stuff. So we're not taking into account any of the Ads requested or anything like that. We’re simply looking at what could they possibly deliver, impression wise. And that's how we're calculating it.",Retailer Media Planner (AdManager), Impressions, Retailers, Placements, Metrics,,,,,,,,,
"So it may be different in the in the core platform, but I suppose the metric we're trying to show them [retailers] is you have this many impressions, total on your website, and your only actually showing Ads to this percentage of them. Basically that's what we're trying to display to them.",Metrics, Retailer Media Planner (AdManager), Impressions, Data challenge,,,,,,,,,,
"OK, because I read something yesterday. Someone showed DataGrid and I see the little bracket to explain what Fill Rate is. And the sounds a little bit different. Linda came comment on that. Do you know what's the Fill Rate?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm not the one working on this. Please let me check the best mode of calculations.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So the Sell-Through we're showing that is actually different. We're not considering the Ads requested in RMP. We're simply saying, based on the positions in the placements you have available and this sort the data. So let's say for example in the last 30 days you had 10 million impressions across your whole website – across all of your placements. We’re then estimating that that will continue over the next 30, 60, [or] 90 days. So that is your total available impressions. And then we're looking at how many campaigns you have planned. And then we're taking the impressions those campaigns would fill, and then looking at the percentage of the total against the ones that you have planned, if that makes sense.",Impressions, Placements, Metrics, Retailer Media Planner (AdManager), Sell-Through Rate,,,,,,,,,
"So if I go, if I go back here. So what we're what we're saying ­– I'll just share my screen again – so I'm currently if I go next three months. So we'll make the next quarter, right? So we're currently in October. Well in October, November, December [as per the 3 month view in the RMP dashboard]. So in here [Top Monetised table] and again, bear in mind this is all old data, but just ignore that fact. And so we're saying this impression capacity figure of 14 million. This is based on the last 30 days data.",Impressions, Retailer Media Planner (AdManager), Data, Date or Time related,,,,,,,,,,
So we're saying in the last 30 days there were five million impressions for chocolate. So we're estimating that there will be 15 million over the next 90 days – because we're just multiplying it by three for that 90 days. For six months with multiplying it by 6. 12 months by 12.,Campaigns, Date or Time related, Sell-Through Rate, Impressions, Banners, Retailer Media Planner (AdManager), SPA (Sponsored Product Ads),,,,,,,
"So we're saying that's the potential capacity based on the existing data. We're then looking at campaigns that exist, or proposals that exist in the planner that use the keyword chocolate. We're then looking at which positions they're booked in – like which banner slots, or which SPA [Sponsored Product Ad] slots for how long. So we're then calculating, based on those bookings, 5 million impressions will be delivered. So then you have a Sell-Through rate of 40%, based on like you've only sold 40% of your 15 million [or] 14 million available impressions based on historical data. Does that make sense?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Oh, I see this. Yeah, it's kind of forecasting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So we're guessing what's going to happen based on the last 30 days data. Ideally to make it more accurate we would look at previous corresponding period where if we had a year's worth of data, we could then look at October last year and then base the estimate on that rather than the last 30 days. Because obviously coming into Petertmas it's going to be wrong. You know the period after Petertmas will be wrong because the impression levels will be really high. But that's what we're doing.",Data, Date or Time related, Retailer Media Planner (AdManager), Impressions,,,,,,,,,,
"OK. I get it. This is to tell them ""Hey, we got this gap"". This 14.2 million of placement to fill in. And go and fill it up and you make money from it. I personally I feel like this is different to the Fill Rate we're talking about.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It sounds like it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And the other thing we're talking about is how much. How much you ask for.  You ask for 100 ads, but actually only like 20 is shown, as in prior. You know, had impressions on our website. I mean the purpose for this rate [in RMP] is different.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yes, I agree. Especially, looking at that that DataGrid calculate learners put there. The sum of impressions divided by the sum of the Ads requested. So yes, slightly different figures there.",DataGrid, Performance, Impressions,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yes. So, one of the key business problems of RMP, that it was trying to solve, is most retailers don't know what their total amount of impressions they have available is. Let alone what they've got booked. So the idea is we can display to them – like this top opportunities table [in the RMP dashboard]. The whole point of this is saying ""Hey, these keywords you're missing out on this potential revenue based on the impressions and the number that you've actually sold"". So it's trying to draw attention to that. And I think probably if they start, sort of solving this problem, then it probably would in turn also solve any Fill Rate issues as well. Because then you going to have more Ads requested. So it'll sort of even itself out, I think. They seem to be like not the same [types of rates] but connected in a way by the looks.",Ad requests, Opportunity, Retailer Media Planner (AdManager), Retailers, Business challenge, Fill Rates, Impressions,,,,,,,
"Hey, Mike, could I just ask you a question on the positions? Is this normalized and for every variation in the retailer. So obviously some of them sell different positions and different amount of positions. Are these figures specific to a retailer?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"They are for Banner but not Sponsored Product, I think at the moment. So that ties into what I was saying before with the campaign API stuff, we are starting to bring in exact positions, placements, all of that data. So instead of us just saying ""OK, you're booking something for a sponsor product position"". With the changes that are coming you would actually be able to say ""OK, you're booking this for sponsored product position 3 on the page"" for example and we know that that position is auction only or something like that. So yes, that will happen in the near future, when the work that they're currently doing is finished.",Auctions, Banners, Campaign Manager (AdManager), API,,,,,,,,,,
"Thanks, Mike. And the other thing is, I think I heard when I started [at AdManager] when I was chatting to Betty. But I'm not sure if this is true, that not all retailers sell every position. If they have positions, they only earmark a certain amount for auction. Like they don't sell everything.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yes. Some of them even go as far as like – the very first client I ever spoke to about RMP was OXO – they have 20 positions. They try to sell them fixed tenancy first. If that doesn't work, they will try to do it like, they'll discount the fixed tenancy rate. Then they'll try auction. Then they'll try and give away the fixed tenancy position. And then if they can't do that, they will then run their own house Ads.",OXO, SPA (Sponsored Product Ads), Placements, FTA (Fixed Tenancy Ads), Retailer Media Planner (AdManager),,,,,,,,,
"So promos, yeah.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We were talking to brand last year and they said OXO, they just tried to open everything up [every placement].",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yeah, because they [OXO] were the first ones to raise the idea of basically auctioning fixed tenancies. So having multiple brands bidding on the fixed tenancy? That was interesting. And it seems to be more retailers are starting to think that way as well.",OXO, Brands, Auctions, FTA (Fixed Tenancy Ads), Bidding,,,,,,,,,
And that makes sense for their business model as well with the online only.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yeah, exactly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thanks for that Mike.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"No, that's alright.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The only reason I could imagine that brand would turn down a free fixed tenancy might be if they don't have the assets ready to go, or something like that. Because I would guess like that would be a very last minute thing [from OXO]. It would just be like ""Hey we've got this slot available from tomorrow"". Obviously, some brands will be able to take advantage of that. But potentially they will be approaching… at least in my mind, if you couldn't sell it, you probably wouldn't approach the brands that would normally pay for it and give it to them for free. You'd probably approach the brands that would never take out a fixed tenancy anyway to try and convince them that it's worthwhile. So maybe it's just a the brand's not mature enough to take it or something like that.",Brands, OXO, FTA (Fixed Tenancy Ads), Value or belief,,,,,,,,,,
"And I could be wrong. But to me, if I was able to sell those fixed tendencies to Coca Cola, for example, and they regularly pay for them. I wouldn't ever offer them one for free. Because then I'm just devaluing what they normally pay for. So I might go to, you know, some really tiny soda brand that has never paid for a fixed tenancy to say ""Hey, would you like to trial one for free for a week or a month or whatever, at no cost to you"". To then see if you do want to buy ones in the future. I think that's how they would do it. But I could be wrong you know. It's all conjecture, I suppose.",FTA (Fixed Tenancy Ads), Value or belief, Brands, Coca-Cola, Future opportunity,,,,,,,,,
"I was just thinking about that Mike, is your reminded me of something else? It could have been Coles; it could have been Sainsbury's. But they said similar to that scenario, when they when they left with a little bit of unfilled [positions] for some of their valued clients, they give away those spaces for free. But they give them away under the banner of promotion as awareness building [Ads]. So they're really kind of focused on impressions, but don't care about the click-throughs [CTR’s] and they're happy to give them. You know, I think it was Sainsbury's and they said from time to time every quarter they said one, they're really primo brands. They might give 5 to 10 thousand [dollars or pounds worth] of awareness building campaigns away for free to those big performing brands, but they're not worried about any click-throughs [CTR’s] at all.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yeah, that's also a possibility, I'd say. I mean, I definitely recommend speaking to OXO about that as well. Just to see their approach to it because they've got such a different business model being solely online and they’re quite a unique case in that regard.",Retailer Media Planner (AdManager), Follow-up, OXO,,,,,,,,,,,
"Can I ask you another question, Mike? Just related back to where you started. I know it sounds obvious you said self-service [clients] is a 2% to 5%, and managed service [clients], 30%. In your own view, why do you think managed services get a lot higher on the Fill Rates? And I know it might sound obvious, but what's your own view on that?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"My personal opinion is that the brands and the retailers probably don't put as much work into optimising and you know, keeping an eye on things compared to a managed service, where it's solely their job to do that, I guess.",Retailers, Brands, Value or belief, Managed service, Optimisation,,,,,,,,,
"Or they don't, or they don't understand the system as good as our internal people, right?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Obviously the our managed service team there in our system, you know 24/7. But it's also their sole job to basically, optimise the campaigns and get them live and get them running and things like that. So that's my thought on it. I mean it's interesting because you don't see as much managed service in like Australasia and things like that. So it seems to be a very US style. I mean, even in Europe, I don't think there's much managed service at the moment.",Optimisation, Europe, APAC, Managed service, USA, Campaigns, Value or belief,,,,,,,
"Apart from like the Carrefour stuff. So it could also just be a different approach to how they do things. I don't know if that's sort of what you were thinking, David, or what you're sort of ideas are around it. Without sort of directly speaking to people and saying ""Why do you think this is?"". That’s sort of my understanding of it.",Follow-up, Value or belief, Carrefour,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yeah, it's probably the ecosystem [research] stuff that we're doing. We're finding a bit of a theme around this digital literacy and expertise. Specifically in the expertise [theme]. And I think you might be right. I think there could be a future bit of research in that. And people have the system, they can access the system. But unlike our Ad OP’s team, they're not really fully aware of all those levers and pullies that they can do and how they granularly affect [Ad performance]. And we're find it could be for some of our self-managed, it's kind of a bit in the too hard basket – bit in that ""I don't really. I'll leave it as it is because I don't know if I'm going to tweak it and overspend and run out of budget too early"". So you know best to do nothing rather than do something too aggressive.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"You know, it could be something like that. I think it's really… as a as a metric, Mike. It's really, really interesting. I'd love to dig into it further, you know, with the team.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yeah, I agree.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
For the info.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Well, I don't know if I've really answered the questions that you were hoping to get answers to.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I learn heaps. It's good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"No, that's good. I'm glad I could help. If you have any other questions, I'm still here for two more days.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Thanks again, Mike. Really appreciate it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That's all good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Alright. Thank you Mike. Thank you everyone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So when it comes to tiers and the way I look at it is that probably for your team probably isn't particularly helpful. So tier fundamentally comes down to how much revenue they're going to make for us. So you'd have the likes of Albertson's and Ahold [Delhaize], who are probably going to generate us millions of profit as tier 1. And the likes of SmartCart and Tech Data and Nectar in Europe, probably Tier 2. They're going to generate us anywhere from 1 to maybe 3 million [in revenue] if they've done really well. And then Tier 3 is under that.",Nectar360, Revenue, Tiers (customers), TD SYNNEX (formerly Tech Data), Retailers, Albertsons, SmartCart (Woolworths), AdManager, Ahold Delhaize,,,,,
"And now obviously for a business, they're all equally important, but realistically they're not. You want to focus on the big ones. So any improvements you're going to make you want to benefit those [retailers] and then generally what it do is it will then filter down so the likes of session ID’s that’s already been mentioned. Everything like that can be used by multiple retailers.",Customer needs, Retailers, UPC or Identifier,,,,,,,,,,,
"If you're thinking about making developments or finding out information – much like we discussed earlier – and what you might want to consider is verticals. So with grocery retailers and they obviously have all the set brands that we know, the Nestle's, Pepsico's, of the world. They will have targets of say 150% to 250% ROAS. And they want a very high conversion rate of 50% to 60% to be able to make enough profit of paying for a click and such like.",Retailers, ROAS, Conversion Rates, Nestle, Pepsico,,,,,,,,,
"If you then look at Tech Data, who were B2B technology, and their model is ever so slightly different. Their order value can be substantially bigger. Because one of the people viewing their platform might actually be a business who's about to place 500,000 Euros worth of IT infrastructure. So therefore, if they're paying for one click, they're ROAS is huge. So the approach is less around the metrics of conversion and more around high impressions and click-through rate [CTR] getting their products and in front of those buyers. But because you've got those buyers who are going to be spending a lot of money, you can be way more aggressive with CPC [Cost Per Click] and growing it.",ROAS, Impressions, B2B, CPC (Cost Per Click), Operations, TD SYNNEX (formerly Tech Data), Brands, CTR (Click Thru Rate), Europe,,,,,
"So like we discussed last week, we had five or six brands competing over the same key search terms on Tech Data and the bid got up to 150 Euros. Now if you compare that to any grocery one, the highest bid is maybe one or two dollars. Maybe the average is probably $1.00. So you have to look at the products they're selling and the vertical they sit in as to how they approach using AdManager.",Brands, Search terms / Keywords, Grocery, AdManager, Bidding,,,,,,,,,
"And then it changes it again for the likes of fashion. Now, if you imagine the buyer behaviour on fashion, your click-through rate is actually very, very low. You might be wanting a shirt for the women in digital [IT industry event in Australia]. So when you go online, you might look at 20 [or] 30 different shirts and click on each one. So you get a high number of clicks but your conversion rates very low. Sorry, not click-through rate. So with them they're using AdManager around awareness [building with buyers] trying to ensure their product is at the top of the page.",Buyer behaviour, AdManager, CTR (Click Thru Rate), Awareness (funnel),,,,,,,,,,
So they all want to have that same goal of getting the product there. But how they use AdManager; the metrics behind it; and what they deem as successful campaign changes vertical to vertical.,Metrics, AdManager, Campaigns,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yeah, grocery. Pretty standard is you're looking at sort of 150 to 250% ROAS. Conversion rate, you're looking from 30 to 60% conversion rate. And then a click-through rate, you’re probably aiming for between 1%  to 1.5%.",Grocery, Conversion Rates, CTR (Click Thru Rate), ROAS,,,,,,,,,,
"You're still right, it is for the brand and the advertiser. But obviously the retailer keeps track of it to ensure that they can go back to the brand and say ""Look at your performance. This is why you should spend more with us. We generate this for you off this amount of budget. If you know invest this amount of budget, we'll make even more"". So yeah, ROAS technically is the metrics for the brand, but it's used by the retailer to be able to sell more to that brand.",Budgets, Opportunity, ROAS, Brands, Retailers, Performance, Metrics,,,,,,,
"Well, retailers pretty much purely care about click-through rate [CTR] because it's click through rate which determines how much revenue they generate. The higher your click-through rates and the higher number of clicks, the higher the revenue you generate. So with ROAS – I mean we've currently got it with Big Basket there ROAS at the moment is a under 100%, but actually they don't really care because they're the market leader in India. The way they're positioning the platform is you pay to spend on our platform and more and more of India will see your products. So we don't really care what you're returns are we can build your [buyer] awareness on a scale you've never been able to do before. However, for them they're mainly focused on the CTR for their actual revenue.",Big Basket, Product, India, Retailers, Awareness (funnel), Revenue, CTR (Click Thru Rate), ROAS,,,,,,
"So it's it then becomes the second one [metric]. So your CTR dictates… I’ll start again. So you know how we kind of discussed last time around, you've got your first six months to a year, and you've got your 18 months.",CTR (Click Thru Rate), Metrics, CPC (Cost Per Click),,,,,,,,,,,
"Right, of course. So what we discussed last time is sort of your phases of a retailer. And you've kind of got two to three different phases. So your first phase is launch. And launch is about building traction. You probably want to aim… we normally aim to get sort of the top 20 brands that run on your platform, live. Get them running a couple of campaigns; putting in test budgets; and starting to build up data that the retailer can use.",Retailers, Business development, Operations, AdManager,,,,,,,,,,
"Then you have sort of phase two if you like. And in that phase, it's then reaching out to sort of the Tier 2 brands, the Tier 3 brands and building saturation and starting to increase the marketing around running a search platform on your ecommerce site and building it up.",Business development, Tiers (customers), Opportunity, Retailers,,,,,,,,,,
"And then you've kind of got phase three, which is all around saturation. So getting each brand to run campaigns on all of their different products. Getting multiple brands competing over the same search term, so becoming saturation.",Business development, Retailers, Search terms / Keywords, Saturation, Bidding, Brands,,,,,,,,
"So if you looked at one of our retailers in a launch phase, they probably got maybe 5% saturation to start. If you then look in that phase two period, you would have saturation of maybe 20% to 40%. And then when you get to that phase three period – like a SmartCart here in Australia – you're probably looking at 60% to 80% on the main search terms. So that's kind of the phases that you have with a retailer. Also, and it's not specific to your team but kind of AdManager as a whole, depending on what phase they're [retailers] in is sort of the requests of what they put into us [AdManager] as a business.",Business development, Saturation, AdManager, Australia, SmartCart (Woolworths), Search terms / Keywords, Retailers,,,,,,,
"So in a phase one retailer and they're just happy to run search and maybe some banners. Whereas you then get to a Phase 3 retailer, and they're the ones that reach out to and say ""What new features are you building? What is your and other capabilities that we can bring on to our platform and what we can do?"". Like an Ahold [Delhaize] with Adfluence for example, is in that period at the minute.",Business development, Ahold Delhaize, Search terms / Keywords, Retailers, Adfluence, Banners, Business norm,,,,,,,
And what was your question just before the phase of the retailer then?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So your first starting metrics for a retailer with CTR.  Because it's the higher the CTR, the more clicks you're getting. Now naturally once you've then got a high CTR and you're getting a high number of clicks, the next way that you generate revenue is by increasing the value of those clicks. So at phase one retailers are mainly focused at getting their CTR to a good place. You're not going to have much competition because you might just have one or two brands targeting each search term, so there's no competing bidding.",CTR (Click Thru Rate), Retailers, Business norm, Revenue, Competitor,,,,,,,,,
"But then once you get into that phase two phase three, that's when they start focusing on getting all of the brands to compete on the same search terms. And then that's when it gives them the opportunity to be able to speak to those brands and say ""Hello, brand B, you're currently not performing as well as brand A. One of the reasons could be your bid, if you want to increase your chance, you need to increase your bid"". And that’s when you start driving the competition on the platform and increasing their CPC.",Search terms / Keywords, Business development, Bidding, Brands, CPC (Cost Per Click), Retailers, Opportunity,,,,,,,
And then the sweet spot for any retailer is a high CTR and a high CPC. Because then that maximises how much revenue you can generate.,CTR (Click Thru Rate), Revenue, CPC (Cost Per Click), Retailer needs, Retailers, Business growth,,,,,,,,
"So, competition for a retailer in relation to AdManager is multiple brands competing on same search terms or categories. And like we say, if you imagine for example Woolworths, they're minimum bid is 50 cents. Now, if they don't have any competition – if Nestle's targeting chocolate and PepsiCo is fizzy drink but they're not crossing over – then they will only ever generate 50 cents on the CPC, no matter how many campaigns they run. What they actually want is Coca Cola and Pepsi both targeting fizzy drink and so on, and so forth. So that's what they're talking about when it comes to competition with AdManager.",Competitor, Woolworths, Coca-Cola, CPC (Cost Per Click), Categories, AdManager, Bidding, Search terms / Keywords, Pepsico, Brands, Nestle,,,
So I'm just trying to follow the flow of the explanation of the different stages of retailer. So my question is a bit further down. So I've been always interested in what are the different revenue models we have to benefit from the retailers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So do you mean revenue to us?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yes, that's our ultimate goal to increase our AdManager revenue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So you kind of have three models. If I go through each of them and then I can do a breakdown of who has what. So you have a flat fee. So grocery, we'll only ever charge you $100,000 a month. And no matter how much or how little that you do through the platform. You then also have Rev share. So once again [for] grocery, we don't charge you anything to use our platform, but we want 15% of all Ad spend that goes through your platform. So as you grow, we grow.",Fees or Charges, Grocery, AdManager, Pricing structure,,,,,,,,,,
"And then the final model is a combination of both of those. So and we will charge you a fee of say 15,000 to $20,000 a month for some of our base costs and then we will give you an 8% revenue share. So we cover some base costs, but then you as a retailer, as you grow, we will then start to reap benefits as well.",Fees or Charges, Opportunity, AdManager, Revenue,,,,,,,,,,
"And now it's not kind of standard who takes what? So it doesn't just come down to what vertical you're in. It depends on market size of business, so on and so forth. So if you look in Australia, Coles and SmartCart, Woolworths, both on a flat fee. If you look at a lot of the retailers in America, a lot of them are predominantly Rev share. And then say for example Big Basket in India and they're a combination of the two.",Revenue, Australia, Retailers, India, Big Basket, USA, Woolworths, SmartCart (Woolworths), Fees or Charges,,,,,
"So it does kind of depend on market factors as to what sort of contracts you have. So when it comes down to focus from AdManager, sometimes it can be difficult who you put your attention on. So for example, for SmartCart for the last two years, we can't actually earn any more money out of them per month. Even if we offer them far more services.",AdManager, Business challenge, Revenue, SmartCart (Woolworths), Contracts,,,,,,,,,
"However, on the flip side, I'm going down there on Wednesday to negotiate a new contract and basically what I've done is I've seen all the data for the last two years and how much it's grown. So I want to increase their contract by 40% to cover the next two years. But it is very subjective.",AdManager, Business growth, Contracts,,,,,,,,,,,
"The ones that could in theory generate AdManager the most amount of revenue are those Rev share ones. So Tech Data who I used to manage in Europe, the first year made us sod-all [little] money. I think it made us about 9000 Euros for the year while we were getting them up and running and launching and learning how AdManager worked. But then in the 4th year when I went, I think it was at 1.6 million Euros – so 3 million AUD [Australian dollars] – all through that Rev share model. So Rev share gives you the biggest opportunity, but also it is the highest risk in the first year of the business. Because the likelihood is you will run at a loss for the first year.",Revenue, Opportunity, Business challenge, TD SYNNEX (formerly Tech Data), AdManager,,,,,,,,,
"Thank you. That makes a lot of sense to me. So in terms of us developing a new feature that could potentially optimise any of the metrics you mentioned like from CTR, CPC to eventually some other metrics. What do you think will be the selling point when we sell this feature to the clients that could either exploit more opportunities from the Rev share, and also open some new opportunities to those flat-fee retailers?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yeah, I think any improvement you can make for base performance. So let's take CTR as a as a simple one. And whenever I'm talking with clients, I always talk about stickiness. And it it's by no means a technical term, but it's just getting AdManager to that point where they can't stop using us.",Performance, Retailer needs, Brand needs, CTR (Click Thru Rate),,,,,,,,,,
"So for example, Woolworths, they've had this target in their mind of 30 million revenue generated by AdManager and actually this year we're going to hit it. So we're now really, really sticky in their business. Something would have to go cataclysmically wrong them to step away. But if you can increase the likes of CTR, all you're doing is generating more revenue for their business.",Revenue, CTR (Click Thru Rate), Retailers, Woolworths,,,,,,,,,,
"So if they are on a Rev share model, that's great. We instantly get gratified and see more revenue. But even if they're on a flat-fee, if that CTR increases their performance. Then the next time you come to contract negotiation you can say ""Last year we made you 10 million. This year we've made you 15 million. We were charging you 100 grand a month because of that growth and everything associated. We're now going to charge you 120 grand a month for the next period of time"".",Fees or Charges, CTR (Click Thru Rate), Revenue, Performance, Business challenge, Business growth, AdManager, Retailers, Contracts,,,,,
"So the only difference is from our side is how quickly we see a return. Yes, the Rev share, we see a return quicker onto our books. But even if you're on a flat fee for an extended period of time, if you increase performance, you get the opportunity to negotiate again when it comes to the end of the contract.",Performance, Contracts, Revenue, Opportunity, Business challenge, AdManager, Fees or Charges,,,,,,,
Yep. Thank you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yeah, I wouldn't say that would annoy them. It's not really an annoyance. What some retailers struggle to see is sometimes they just focus on CPC. And what they'll see is a bit like when we had the issue with the relevancy with PharmEasy. They'll see that brand A is bidding 1 dollar and every other brand is bidding 10 cents. So in their mind, they automatically think that the 1 dollar one [bid] is better. Because in theory if you just look at the same 10 cents and 1 dollar. Ones making the 90 cents more. But actually you have to look at CTR as well. Because if the CTR of the 1 dollar [bid] is 0.1 [of a percent] and the CTR the 10 cents is 5% then actually you're getting way more clicks on the 10 cents and generating more revenue.",Brands, CPC (Cost Per Click), Revenue, PharmEasy, Bidding, Relevancy, CTR (Click Thru Rate), Retailers,,,,,,
"So when a retailer sometimes gets annoyed is when potentially our algorithm doesn't show the 1 dollar one enough. But it is that education piece of saying just because it's a bigger number [bid amount] doesn't necessarily mean it's actually going to generate you the most amount of revenue. So it's a very difficult one for you guys if you're managing it and how you juggle the two. And obviously we've seen it where some companies have considered doing and what do we call it, I think first prize or whatever. So whoever bids the highest automatically their one [Sponsored Product Ad] is seen.",Operations, Revenue, Bidding, Education, SPA (Sponsored Product Ads), Retailers, Frustration, Guidance, Advice and guidance,,,,,
But from what I understand I think we tried it in Europe a couple of years back. Actually the performance wasn't very good because a lot of irrelevant adverts were being shown and it didn't benefit them.,Europe, Relevancy, Impact, Performance, Negative feedback,,,,,,,,,
"Other areas. It's becoming more relevant now CPC on cross-sell, we've already touched base on that.",Opportunity, CPC (Cost Per Click), Cross-sell,,,,,,,,,,,
"I've discussed this with some other people, like John as well. So we we've had more requests from retailers now to have CPM [Cost Per Mille – thousand] model for cross-sell placements. So at the moment, we obviously have CPC for all product Ads. Which has always worked for search or category because you get a high CTR. If you type in coffee and I show you coffee, the likelihood is you're going to click on it. Now more people are using our cross-sell placement, what we're seeing is actually quite a low CTR. Which in theory actually is natural because if I type in coffee and I see milk, I might click on it. I might not because it's not the actual product I've searched for.",CPM (Cost per Mille/Thousand), SPA (Sponsored Product Ads), Categories, Search terms / Keywords, Retailers, CTR (Click Thru Rate), Retailer needs, CPC (Cost Per Click), Cross-sell,,,,,
"So actually what a lot of retailers are now saying is rather than trying to convince someone to purchase, you're just giving someone a nudge or putting a product in front of someone to kind of trigger an idea to look at it [i.e. building awareness or consideration]. But it means the CTR is very low, so they're not making much money from their CPC. So what they want to see now is having CPC for search category campaigns, and then CPM for cross-cell campaigns, so that they [retailers] can essentially make more revenue from it.",Search terms / Keywords, Point of purchase, Revenue, Cross-sell, Campaigns, CTR (Click Thru Rate), Consideration (funnel), CPM (Cost per Mille/Thousand), Opportunity, Retailers, Categories, CPC (Cost Per Click), Awareness (funnel),
Do we already have some working examples of cross-sell? As far as I know that our category is not. I mean the data we have is not clean and refined enough to generate some accurate cross-selling opportunities.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yeah, we do have cross-sell campaigns that… Well, I mean it depends what you can determine as success. We have retailers using cross-sell is probably a better phrase for it. And lots of it. We have search cross-sell; we have category cross-sell; and we have PDP [Product Description/Details Page] cross-sell. So the retailers are happy with the logic of how it works. It's just what we've seen as the performance is actually lower than what they require.",Cross-sell, Campaigns, PDP (Product Display Page), Search terms / Keywords, Categories, Impact, Campaigns, Performance, Retailers,,,,,
"Now don't be wrong. Just because we change it to a CPM doesn't suddenly mean that the brands will necessarily love it, because the ROAS will still be very, very small. But it means actually the retailers can generate some revenue from it. Whereas at the moment the reality is none of them are making any revenue from cross-sell. So I think it will come to the point where people will just stop using it – is what I think will happen.",Cross-sell, Opportunity, ROAS, Revenue, CPM (Cost per Mille/Thousand), Retailers, Brands,,,,,,,
"Correct, yeah.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Depending on how you talk to in AdManager, there are various exotic grand plans which people put in place. But no, you've hit the nail on the head. So what you will normally see from a brand is they will be quite specific. So they will use AdManager, and what they want to do is they'll want to promote either a high margin product or maybe a new product launch, or a high stock product. And all of those campaigns work reasonably well.",Product, Opportunity, AdManager, Brand needs, Promotions, Brands,,,,,,,,
What I always educate brands to do is do a mixture. So include that high-margin product in there. But also include your high stock. Put them all into a campaign. Let the AdManager campaign show you the various different products at different [spend and performance] points. And almost self-optimise and it'll start to show the product that was purchased most frequently in front of them.,Advice and guidance, Brands, Education, Spend, Optimisation, Self-serve, Product, Point of purchase, Performance, Campaigns,,,,
"So yeah, it's not a complicated science. When it comes to brands and what they should do. Run a campaign for each product set. So if you're someone that sells chocolates, fizzy drinks and crisps, run a campaign for each one. A lot of brands will just do one, even if they say good results – no logic why. Within those campaigns have a diverse selection of keywords. And also within those campaigns have a diverse selection of products. And as long as you do all that, then your campaigns will work well.",Search terms / Keywords, Product, Campaigns, Routine activity, Brands,,,,,,,,,
"You'll have some who will overthink it so they'll have day-spending or they turn their campaigns off on a weekend, or they'll do something else. From my experience, those campaigns always perform less well than the ones where you cover everything and let it run. One of the main reasons, there's two arguments to this. Some people say ""death by adverts"". If you keep on seeing the same product [as a buyer/consumer], then you get annoyed and you won't look at it. From what I've seen from my experience of AdManager, is actually the more frequently you show in advert, you just get to the point where someone turns around and actually clicks and then eventually purchases it.",Poor performance, Campaigns, Spend, Point of purchase, Hack or Workaround,,,,,,,,,
"I mean this is pretty much exactly the same way. So a retailer, depending on how who you speak to a retailer, you'll have some retailers who wants to get maximum performance from their brands. You'll have other ones who just want to get the revenue on their books. But assuming you've got a retailer who cares about their brands, they will be doing exactly the same as the likes of Marie, Basia [AdManager CSM’s] and all the people in here. So educating them and helping them set up their campaigns. Doing optimisation of campaigns after a period of time.",Performance, AdManager, Revenue, Education, Optimisation, Retailers, Retailer needs, Advice and guidance,,,,,,
"The big one that retailers should be doing as well is what's called size of opportunity. So what you'll find quite regularly is a brand will put in $10,000 and get good results and go ""Excellent. I'll do $10,000 next time and get good results, and then I'll do it again and again"". And in theory, that sounds what you should be doing. Actually what you need to do is go will your $10,000 lasted for three weeks. Your campaign you wanted to run for a quarter [3 months], so actually what you want to do is run it for 12 weeks. So if you put in 10 grand, what you need to do is put in 45 grand, then it will run longer.",Brands, Retailers, Opportunity, Spend, Routine activity,,,,,,,,,
"So what I've always pushed for through AdManager – and it's kind of being looked at by RMP – is any sort of service that we could offer to a retailer, which automatically does that for them and sort of a post-campaign analysis. And that would be of benefit to them as well. But the actual helping of the brand [by retailers] is very similar to what the CSM’s do.",Retailer Media Planner (AdManager), Performance, Opportunity, Retailers,,,,,,,,,,
"Yeah, I mean It is. I mean, at the most basic part is yes, it's their cost. And it's also why whenever I speak to a brand, you need to discuss cost but also revenue output as well. If you ever just speak to a brand and say I've spent $10,000 this month and don't say anything else, then they'll view AdManager with a negative light. But you say you spent $10,000 and generated $150,000, then suddenly and it's more appealing.",Revenue, Advice and guidance, Cost structure, Brands,,,,,,,,,,
"If you then talking about how do you sort of build that CPI or the CPC with them. That's the whole story around – and it's difficult to quantify – but you're saying ""Right, well then if your share a voice. You're currently bidding 1 Euro and you're winning 15% of the traffic. If you increase your bid to 1 Euro 50 [cents] and you start beating competitors, you might win 60% of the traffic"". So therefore you'll have four times the number of sales. So you're cost gone up 50%, but your sales have gone up 400%.",CPI (Cost Per Impression), Sales, Share of Voice, Bidding, CPC (Cost Per Click), Brands,,,,,,,,
"Now, if we could ever design a tool or something which almost automatically suggests that. So we kind of got winning bid at the moment. But if we could ever have anything which is, you log on, you see it and you suggest automatically and say your bid should be up to 120 [120 cents]. Do you want to accept something like that? That could be an idea. But that's very similar to winning bid on the platform that we already have.",Guidance, Opportunity, AdManager, Bidding, Automation,,,,,,,,,
"None of the logic really changes and it's just number of eyeballs. So and if you think around Petertmas time, I think SmartCart's traffic goes off about 20%. So you could argue if you really want a time of year where you want to be ultra-aggressive with your bidding and win the highest amount of traffic, then it's that period of time that you want to bid the most. But in reality, if you've got a million searches and you win all of those as clicks, you pay the million searches time your CPC and you get the revenue from it. If you've got 1 and a half million [clicks], all of the logic stays the same. You still have the same product in there, the same search term, everything like that. So seasonality generally effects how quickly your budget goes and how much revenue you generate. But every other logic around the campaign stays exactly the same.",Budgets, Revenue, SmartCart (Woolworths), Search terms / Keywords, CPC (Cost Per Click), Bidding,,,,,,,,

"Yes, that's correct. I mean, like I say that would that is very similar to winning bid. I think and I have no idea how you'd put this into the platform – I'm just spit-balling as they say. If we could have any sort of feature that shows potentially, I don't know, how many more Ad requests you'll win from having that higher bid then that would help any sales to a brand.

"Now, as I said, I've got no idea if that's even possible, how you could put it in there. But I think a brand would find that quite appealing. ""OK, great.

But as I say, I mean I've got no idea if that's even possible.",Bidding, Brands,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Because brands are quite short sighted. So the brand will probably hear ""OK, well if I increase my bid, then I'm just paying more"". They won't see the outcome from it. But if you tell them, yeah, if you increase your bid by 50%, but you could potentially see four times the amount of traffic. Your sales at the moment are $1000, they would then be $4000.

You can talk about putting a more relevant product, but you can't directly influence it. Whereas you can directly influence saturation. You can directly influence and CPC. So that's what I used to try and get the CSM's to focus on whenever they were trying to build revenue for the retailers.",Saturation, Relevancy, Opportunity, CTR (Click Thru Rate), Revenue, Product, CPC (Cost Per Click), Retailers,,,,,,
"So that's probably when you start getting into your realms of stage two, or stage three of your retailers. So as they're progressing. OK, you're doing pretty well. You've got 40% saturation in your search. 35% in your category. OK, you're not running banners yet. This is about the time where we'll bring in banners and stuff like that. So you've different placements are as you progress your retail and you get them doing more. There's no set-in-stone rule, but that's sort of the way.",Saturation, Retailers,,,,,,,,,,,,
"There is no rhyme nor reason. So the one thing I always put in place is, I don't care which placement you give AdManager, but I want slot 1. Because that's the most impactful one. So whenever you have [placement] 1, 4, 5, [or] 6. So if you have you have [placements]  1, 3, 9, 12; whether you have 1, 2, 7, [or] 8. I don't really care as me running your site. But I want position 1 because that's the easiest one to paint a story around. You’re front; you’re first. You're guaranteed to be in front of a buyer. You're always going to be beating organic results, so on and so forth. But yeah, if you opened up a fair price, Woolworths and Coles, where their placements are in positions, they're all different.",Retailers, Preference, Operations, Brands, Woolworths, Coles, Placements,,,,,,,
"Yeah. So you've just typed in coffee and the first product you see, whether or not the lines go across or not, they go down and that slot 1. And me selling it to a brand that's the easiest one to sell, going ""You will be the first thing that appears in front of a user when they run a search"".",Search terms / Keywords, Opportunity, Product,,,,,,,,,,,
"And that's the way slots work. So if I say slots 1, 3 and 5, that means slot 1 is a AdManager advert, slot 2 is an organic result, slot 3 is a AdManager advert, slot 4 is an organic results, slot 5 is a AdManager advert. So that's when we talk about slots.",Placements, AdManager,,,,,,,,,,,,

"So it's funny. So yes, everyone talks about Tier 1, 2 and 3 retailers. And they talk about Tier 1, 2 and 3 brands. Yet I personally still don't have a clear understanding of what those are. So we've never defined it. We're trying now, right Linda reminded me too, when I saw you.",Understanding vague, Tiers (customers),,,,,,,,,,,,
"Because I feel like it's kind of a weird dynamic, right? We actually need to deal with the brand more so than the retailer. The retailer pays our bills, but it's the brand that's spending the money. And it's the brand that we need to double the Ad Spend with. And so I feel like actually our focus is more on the Tier 1, 2 and 3 brands, and how we segregate that to be able to do that.",Brands, Tiers (customers), Retailers, Spend,,,,,,,,,,
"So at the moment, across the board, we're trying to be a one-stop shop for everyone. And that never works in product, at all. You need to kind of work out who your markets are, and how you tailor them differently and who we focus, on that basis. So we do have a very classic sort of, massive retailer like Target [in US]. Retailer like – they're not a customer of ours – I just think of like JB Hi-fi. And sort of the people in the middle. The people [retailers] up the top end up costing you a lot of money because they want custom integrations. They need massive infrastructure. And they need high response times to stay up and going. And so need to look into whether the money that they give us actually offsets the amount that they cost us. And I don't think we've got that proper P&L [Profit & Loss] yet understand whether they're even worth going after, or worth really pursuing in this space in terms of putting a lot of effort into them.",JB Hi-Fi, Retailers, Target, Complexity, Business challenge,,,,,,,,,
"As in the revenue that we can make out of them and how we get that. So the Ad revenue ultimately provide they’re on rev-share [revenue sharing model]. I think that's part of our problem is that we've got retailers on – especially for on-site; off-site's not a problem because they're all on rev-share, and a massive rev-share. That's why off-site does so well with on site.",Pricing structure, Business challenge, Revenue,,,,,,,,,,,
"We've got a lot of bespoke contracts and that's where we struggle. This is where that goal of doubling Ad Spend actually may not turn around into dollars for us, in the end for on-site. We still should be working out how to double that Ad spend. And then part of what we need to do strategically is turn all of the contracts from a SaaS model back to rev-share.",Contracts, Business growth, Business challenge, Revenue,,,,,,,,,,
"We used to do rev-share in the early days of AdManager. And the reason we did that was obviously it's a start-up product. So Brad used to go out [to clients] going ""Look, if we don't make money, you don't make money"". And so that was the model of why he did rev-share to start with. But then we weren't making enough money, so then he changed it to SaaS, where it was a fixed cost kind of thing, or a fixed amount each month to kind of make it sort of [financial] ‘books’ thing a little bit more solid, right? He had solid income coming through.",Revenue, Pricing structure, AdManager,,,,,,,,,,,
"We obviously now know that it's a product that generates money. And so for us to make true money because we've got some retailers that do really, really well and some that don't. And so then that SaaS model doesn't always work. So we're not getting the scoop of those ones that are doing exceedingly well. Or, they [retailers] are not on the right model to be able to make money out of them. So we need to come back to swapping them all over, to rev-share. And then the doubling of Ad Spend will end up with money in our pockets, if that makes sense.",Revenue, AdManager, Business challenge,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yeah. So the fixed-cost ones are the ones [retailers] that are killing us the most. Sainsbury's as an example is a Tier 1 retailer that generates a lot of revenue, yet we're on a fixed cost. So they're not even on SaaS, which means like obviously SaaS can fluctuate depending on the traffic and things. They're on, just a fixed cost every month. And so we are losing money like you wouldn't believe we're Sainsbury's because of that. And so there's this commercial aspect too, behind [it]. I don't know if this is what you want.",Revenue, AdManager, Impact, Business challenge, Pricing structure,,,,,,,,,
"Yes, but I don't want us to be blindsided by that. That is something that sales & finance and everyone need to address. And that's something that we need to raise as part of the strategy. And this is the thing we feel like there's huge opportunity to double Ad Spend. There's a lot of sentiment around off-site, generating 75% of the revenue. I actually think that's because we're not optimizing on-site, right?",Future challenge, AdManager, Revenue,,,,,,,,,,,
"And so that's why we've set this lofty goal of doubling Ad Spend. Because we feel like we can in on-site. And we can almost show them [retailers] that on-site can generate, you know, just as much hopefully as off-side. Maybe not quite, as they've got scale. But still there's a lot I reckon we could almost shift it to, I don't know 60, 40 or like ideally 50-50 [split between on-site and off-site revenue for AdManager] if we could, right. So that's sort of where we're at. Because we're just not did up to optimise that spend, at the moment.  Think we need to prove that, yeah.",AdManager, Revenue, Future challenge,,,,,,,,,,,
"Hey, Betty. Thanks for that. Would you mind clarifying for the group because I'm not going to make the assumption everyone in the group understands. So when we talk off-site and we talked to the full scope of offsite as well, so kind of thinking of social [media channels] and DOOH [Digital Out Of Home video] and video on demand. Would you talk about that as well, and give the group a bit more on that?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So off-site generally is… the majority of off-site is obviously advertising out on the worldwide webs like browsing [the web], off-site banners will pop up. EllisX does that and does that quite well. So their job is very much gathering from a massive audience and narrowing it down and bringing them into point-of-sale to the retailer's website. So they have the world of population. And so they've worked out all sorts of ways of targeting the right people and getting them to come to the point-of-sale. And then obviously AdManager's job is then to reinforce that and get the people to actually buy.",On-site, EllisX, Banners, AdManager, Audience targeting,,,,,,,,,
"So EllisXs scope is massive, whereas then we are… our needs are quite different across off-site and on-site. On-site is you've got people that are ready to buy, so how do you actually get them to buy. Whereas off-site is like, let's narrow down the world population basically down to a few people that come through to the website and I'm likely to buy. So it's a good partnership. And the way they [EllisX] do that is on the web. It's very intricate with the way that they sort of spread themselves as they talk about publisher networks and things like that. But we won't get too bogged down in the semantics of that.",EllisX, On-site, Publishers,,,,,,,,,,,
"But out on the web, they're [EllisX] looking at social. I still need to get a bit more context on social. I think it's kind of a bit of a Wizard of Oz thing where they've got people just creating campaigns on Facebook, at the moment, and offering it as basically a service with their off-site managed service. But I feel like they want to kind of evolve that space. It's new. That's something just been launched this year. They [EllisX] talk about DOOH, their digital out of home [offering] and CTV [Connected TV], which is like you’re in Netflix and things like that. How there's Ads on those? Which is not as popular in Australia at the moment. But that's all sort of taking off. That's very big in the US – feeding those Ads through to the actual devices, and things like that. And there’s the digital out of home [DOOH].",Digital video, DOOH (Digital Out Of Home), Facebook, CTV (Connected TV), EllisX, Social media, Mobile, USA, Managed service,,,,,
"Obviously in-store is something we want to start investigating. I still consider in-store… like to me email social digital out of home, CTV is kind of all off-site – but they kind of talk about them being channels because for me logically to think about it on-site is on the retailer’s website. Off-site is anything not on the retailer's website but device driven, and so on and so forth. And then obviously in-store’s physically in-store. But I think offsite very much divide out those channels of social and email and digital out of home as separate things.",Off-site, CTV (Connected TV), On-site, Retailers, Digital channels, In-store, Social media,,,,,,,
Email is a space that they [EllisX] offer at the moment through their people cloud messaging. Where they are kind of like an ESP [Email Service Provider]. I guess People Cloud Messaging is like it and ESP.,Cloud People Messaging (EllisX), Email programmes, EllisX,,,,,,,,,,,
"Email service provider? So kind of like Gmail or whatever. So they say to the retailer ""We’ll take care of all your email marketing"". So they cover like monthly newsletters with the retailer. All of that sort of stuff through People Cloud Messaging. What they're starting to get into now is, and you will hear that they're talking about like kind of replacing like being ESP agnostic. So they're kind of building a little connector. LiveIntent sort of does that as well. That's a company at the moment that that is probably the direct competitor to EllisX in that space where they're building a little connector between their system and People Cloud Messaging that allows them to actually use any sort of ESP to send that messaging.",Email programmes, Gmail, Future opportunity, LiveIntent, EllisX, Cloud People Messaging (EllisX),,,,,,,,
"So they [EllisX] still get the money and it can still be sent out using their [retailers] SurveyMonkey or their Gmail, or whatever sort of doing. Because the problem that they had was, the retailers don't necessarily want to shift all of their email marketing over from the tooling that they have to People Cloud Messaging. That they were building this little connector to be able to help do that. Then the next piece of that is building like connecting that little connect us through to AdManager. So then that they can have the email placements be optioned [to brands], and so on and so forth. And be set up within the AdManager system to then go and bounce through to People Cloud Messaging and get sent out.",SurveyMonkey, Gmail, EllisX, Cloud People Messaging (EllisX),,,,,,,,,,
"The notifications is kind of the first part of that. That's our first sort of small connector into not necessarily the email part of it, but definitely sort of using People Cloud Messaging to send out email notifications. Not necessarily email marketing, but you can see how it kind of starting to bring all of that suite [of tools] together.",Cloud People Messaging (EllisX), Notifications, Integrations,,,,,,,,,,,
They’re very different horses for courses.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Offsite, the biggest play for offsite is audience targeting, right? Whereas for on-site that's not a big thing. So that's always a conversation that's interesting to have. That audience targeting, ConsumerID, all that sort of stuff is the absolute bread and butter of what EllisX do. If you can't get the right people on to the website in the first place, they're [consumers] not going to likely buy. You're not going to get the return on Ad spend [ROAS], right?",Off-site, ConsumerID (EllisX), ROAS, On-site, Buyer behaviour, Audience targeting, EllisX, Spend,,,,,,
"So they really need to focus in on nailing the right audience to bring to the website. So audience targeting; buying behaviour; browsing behaviour; all of those things, you know, different devices connecting through all the stuff that ConsumerID does to pull all of that identity of the person browsing and pick the right people to go off to the retailer's website. And ideally the right retailers’ website. Like that's another little avenue we could explore, right. We you know you might purchase from Myers the most, but Linda might purchase from David Jones. And so it's like direct you [person A] to the Myer website direct you [person B] to the David Jones website because you're more likely to buy.",Buyer behaviour, Consumer/Buyer data, Off-site, Point of purchase, ConsumerID (EllisX), Audience targeting,,,,,,,,
"Whereas on site we've got you, we've got you as a David Jones buyer and you're now on the David Jones website. So all we need to do is guide you through to your purchase, from an on-site perspective. So we don't necessarily need to then target you further from a demographic or whatever. Like there's a lot of – finding with brands particularly at the moment – audience targeting seems to be the cool thing to do, right. And we're trying to work out whether is that actually going to help with your buying behaviour or is it more about how you're browsing on the website. You know, category search, whatever and tailoring those Ads based on your website browsing behaviour more so than anything to get you to buy.",Point of purchase, Buyer behaviour, Consumer/Buyer data, On-site,,,,,,,,,,
So where does our customer identity segmentation come from? Is [it] ConsumerID?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It’s ConsumerID. It's interesting. I really want everyone to understand a little bit more about ConsumerID from a layman's perspective. I'm sure you all had ConsumerID training where they [EllisX] talk about, you know, don't say that it's shared data. But I don't think what we've been trained in very clearly sends the message of the power of ConsumerID and the presence of ConsumerID.",ConsumerID (EllisX), EllisX,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So obviously ConsumerID is gathering data on your devices and linking it all together. You know, anonymising it, all of those sorts of wonderful things that we hear. But what does that mean in practicality? And the other part of this is ConsumerID is not present in the Australian market. We can't use it in the Australian market. So that hasn't been explored. It's very, very big in the US. It's starting to get traction in the EU, but it's not in Australia at all.",Consumer/Buyer data, Business challenge, Australia, USA, Europe, ConsumerID (EllisX),,,,,,,,
"The way to get it into Australia – and obviously we're having these conversations – like from a grocery perspective I guess, but even ancillary to that is Everyday Rewards and Flybys. I'd say 95% coverage of the Australian population, right? And so what needs to happen is EllisX needs to partner with those guys [reward cards] and kind of work out a way. And that's beyond our pay grade. But that's what needs to happen. They need to pair with Everyday Rewards and Flybys because then you have that identity graph of pretty much the most of the Australian population.",Australia, Future opportunity, AdManager, EllisX,,,,,,,,,,
"So what we probably need to do – with definitely for ConsumerID in the US – we need to start feeding that into our on-site. Sort of relevancy, potentially. Like while I say audience targeting is not as powerful and on-site, it still will help with some of that category browsing and search browsing and stuff, right? Like we've got you onto the David Jones website, but we now also need to use the fact that you've bought a lot of shoes on the David Jones website before. So, which shoes are they? And so which shoes should we show you when you're browsing in the shoes category? We could be using that sort of information. And that information will be in that ConsumerID.",ConsumerID (EllisX), USA, Relevancy, Buyer behaviour,,,,,,,,,,
"In the meantime, we probably need to start thinking about ""Well, what's kind of the equivalent in Australia that can help us?"".  In the meantime, until we get ConsumerID presence, is Woolies going to share their Everyday Rewards data with us directly? I doubt it. And so there's more around like the CDP's - the customer database type things. Like we were talking to Adobe the other day. So Coles use Adobe [Adobe Experience Manager] as their customer sort of data-centric thing. And so is it more about us working with Adobe on how we can start feeding some of that information into our relevancy. In the same way that we would with ConsumerID. And like I don't know whether – this is like literally conversation three days ago – so I'm not saying that it's something we should do. If there's a lot more obviously commercials and all of that sort of stuff that would need to go into it.",Future opportunity, Adobe, CDP (Customer Data Platform), Consumer/Buyer data, Australia, ConsumerID (EllisX),,,,,,,,
"But we should still be thinking about like, if there's no ConsumerID presence in Australia, how are we feeling ConsumerID in from the US and is there something that we could substitute in the meantime in Australia to get that same benefit. But we could be using ConsumerID in the US as our first sort of like test case. Because Gopuff, for example, is integrated with ConsumerID. So could we start using something for some of the data in that ConsumerID to tailor some of the on-site stuff?",Business challenge, ConsumerID (EllisX), Australia, goPuff, Integrations,,,,,,,,,
"So I'm happy to hear the ConsumerID does exist and they are actually data in it. Because, to me it was kind of elusive at some point after doing all these training. Where's the data? I want to see the use cases.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yeah. And I think that's the thing is like we talked about ConsumerID a lot, and the fact that we’ve got it. But we’re not using it. That's the biggest [thing]. But we've got customers that have it. So to be an EllisX customer you have to be integrated with ConsumerID. So it's more about now, OK let's show how that could help us in on-site.",ConsumerID (EllisX), On-site, EllisX,,,,,,,,,,,
"Oh it's more about the benefit to us. So it's not necessarily that they’re doing better or worse. It's more that we lose out on a flat-fee with Sainsbury's cause they're generating a lot of money. We know they generate a lot of money, and they are pushing more placements. So all retailers at the moment are, umm, obviously seeing the benefit and the returns of retail in general. So they're trying to put as much as possible as to how they like – for lack of a better word – exploit that more. Right. And so it's about, you know placements and like how can they [retailers] monetise more. So we have lots of conversations with Sainsburys and Woolworths in particular. They I feel like a fairly powerful in their 2 regions in terms of their strategy and their forward-thinking about how to, you know, expand their retail media offering.",Woolworths, Retailers, Revenue, Sainsburys, Business challenge, Conversion Rates, AdManager, Placements, Future opportunity,,,,,
"So they're looking at it from all different angles. They're wanting to have more placements. They're wanting to optimise their placements. And even the simple thing like in Woolworths, where they weren't requesting Ads on subsequent pages. Like with pagination, they would only ever request on the first page. Like it's things like that blow my mind. We as a business haven't gotten in there and said that's what you need to do to make more money out of this.",Ad requests, Woolworths, Placements, Advice and guidance, Future opportunity,,,,,,,,,
"I guess the flip side of that Sainsbury's is we could go give them all like that advice and they're implementing all of that stuff and they're suddenly making lots and lots and lots more revenue from it. Yeah, we're sitting here [in the same spot]. The money that we get back from them. So our return on investing with them is not working. So their contract needs to change versus like there might be some retailers that had potential, but for technical limitation reasons they haven't got their placements sorted. They haven't got the tech teams to support them, you know, to do those requests.",AdManager, Advice and guidance, Revenue, Business challenge, ROI, Sainsburys,,,,,,,,
"There's a lot of them have outsourced [their] website development and all of that sort of thing. So they have to rely on that [outsourced] team – like OXO, is the example – so they provide OXO and other retailers there their website so to speak and so it's up to them to be able to build the requests, the Ad requests and things to be able to get our Ads. They [OXO] don't have that in-house. And so they're sort of hamstrung by [the agency] OSP building, say, a banner Ad request to our system to be able to get that to come through into like an OXO retail website.",Retailers, Ad requests, Operations, OXO, Business challenge, Agencies,,,,,,,,
"So based on that they may not be meeting the bare minimum. So we’re making money off them and that might not necessarily be helping them. But their fixed cost things that they need to drive harder to be able to like, make sure that they're meeting that. But we're making money out of them because they're not generating as much money when I should be. But that's on them to do.",Pricing structure, Revenue, Expectations,,,,,,,,,,,
"Every 2 or 3 years. So it's hard, some of the big ones have been only renegotiated recently. So it's still got another couple of years ago. So yeah, that's another one of our problems with 2024, is like how many contracts can we actually shift to rev- share?",Contracts, Business norm,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And yeah, there's been a lot of favours and handshakes and things, especially with Sainsbury's. You know, things that have been written into contracts that weren’t aware of. You know the dev[elopment] credits. Those sorts of things that they end up losing us money. So there's a lot of that sort of stuff that, again, it doesn't affect you guys necessarily, but it's going to affect the bottom line in the end.",AdManager, Business norm, Revenue, Routine activity, Contracts, Business challenge,,,,,,,,
"No we don't. It's a very interesting dynamic. I had it like in the medical software that I worked with as well was like obviously the doctors were our customers, but ultimately, it's the patients that make the doctor's money., and then obviously, then pay off. And so you ultimately almost have to satisfy the patients’ needs to be able to then get the money out of the doctor. It's a similar loop, right?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And so it's difficult because the business as a whole will focus on retailers because they give us the money. But I feel from a product perspective, we're serving the brands. And so our focus should be on the brands and their experience to be able to then give the retailers the return, right. So it's not necessarily our whole model needs to change to brands, but we need to be thinking more about the brands and how to serve them best.",Revenue, Customer needs, Business challenge, Retailers, AdManager, Future opportunity, Brands,,,,,,,
"And so, going into 2024, I'd like to have a really good strategy around who is our UI for versus who is our API for? So I think it's very clear for Tier 1 and a portion of Tier 2 brands – and this is the data that I'm starting to get you to help me with – is that they need to do stuff at a scale that our UI is not ready for and it probably take us another year or more to be able to get out UI to serve them. When there's so many other products out there on the market, aggregated products and things that can do the job. If they're using our API, we're still getting the money right?",Tiers (customers), Revenue, Future opportunity, API, UI, Customer needs, Expectations,,,,,,,
"And so why are we trying to put our equity into a UI to be your one-stop shop to suit everyone when in that sense, it's kind of not suiting anyone at the moment. So I really want us to focus more on what is the definition of each of those tiers of brands. What are their behaviours? So you know your Tier 1’s, probably 90% of them are managed by services or agencies. And so that's actually our customer rather than the brand. And a lot of those agencies and managed services already use tooling like Salesforce or Placements or Pacvue or Skai.",Skai (Kenshoo), Expectations, Agencies, SalesForce, Pacvue, UI, Managed service, Brands, Tiers (customers),,,,,
"And so we're getting there. Obviously, we've started those things with Skai and Pacvue, but it's falling short because they need the whole picture to be able to actually be efficient and effective. And so why aren't we leveraging their bulk actions and their pacing and all of that sort of stuff and keep our UI for the guys that can't afford agencies or can't afford managed services or don't have enough spend?",Business challenge, Customer needs, Agencies, Bulk actions, Skai (Kenshoo), Pacing, Limitation, Pacvue,,,,,,
"So the minimum spend for an off-site campaign – because EllisX is 100% managed services U.S. company US tend to do more to manage service stuff – they have a minimum spend of 10,000 [US dollars] per campaign for the retailer. And there's people that can't spend that much. And so I'm sort of going, why aren't we targeting the people that can't afford or don't have the structure to be able to have an agency or managed service? Why don't we start looking at how to service those guys in our UI and keep that all automated and almost have it as its own self-return system.",Spend, Future opportunity, UI, EllisX, Off-site, Managed service, Self-serve,,,,,,,
"So with our Unified UI, that whole off-site piece, they still need hands on keyboards at the other end to launch it. So why don't we say ""OK, well, let's try and get that stream of that UI that you don't need a hands-on keyboard the other end to launch it"". And have like bounce [customer churn] around you can only have this particular audience targeting; you can't have custom audience targeting. It's these three types you choose from those and get the EllisX system to auto-launch those within seeing the bounds of what the UI's sending through. There's a lot of that sort of stuff, yeah.",UI, Customer needs, Manual effort, Audience targeting, EllisX, Off-site,,,,,,,,
It's totally different perspective because yesterday we was talking about the stickiness with retailers and now we kind of discover that all your suppliers have to keep like maintain the stickiness with them because they are the ones running campaigns.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The ones with the money. They’re paying the retailer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So in terms of how we can in terms of the development of the algorithm, how could this contribute keeping the suppliers happy. So now we're looking at optimising the CTR [Click Through Rate], which is metric that everyone is interested at the moment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It's probably more ROAS. Like we want better return on Ad Spend. So I guess the whole way that brands work is  – are I might possibly have said this to you before, but I suppose for everyone on the on the call is – their main aim is they get a yearly budget. And then need to spend that budget. And then you spend that budget perfectly. So, they can't have it all spend in the beginning of the year. They can't have a whole heap left at the end of the year. And so our job is to ultimately disperse that spend nicely across the year, across the quarter, like whatever they're sort of time frame is. But they get given money to promote their products in whatever way. And it's our job to make sure that it doesn't burn too fast or burn too slow.",Expectations, Budgets, Business norm, ROAS, Brands, Spend,,,,,,,,
"So the moment we're sort of sitting in the space where it's probably burning too slow for a lot of brands. And we could be doing more to get that budget to burn through, right. I suppose it’s not everything. It depends on what their what their motivation is. Generally it is just like for new products. It's generally just brand exposure, so it's just impressions. It's not necessarily ROAS. But for a lot of people it is trying to drive sales, right? And so if we're not spending that budget in the way that they expect, they'll either lift it and move it to another platform or they have to prove to their executives or whatever, that they could have spent more, but you know the platform let them down. Or like Woolies didn't have their usual massive sale that they usually have at this time of the year. So then they have to work out why it didn't spend. Because if their money doesn't spend by the end of the time period, it ultimately ends up getting taken away from them. And they have a lesser budget for the next quarter or the next year or whatever.",Business challenge, ROAS, Woolworths, Brands, Impressions, Sales,,,,,,,,
"So I believe – we'd have to look into the data – but I believe the majority of use cases is under-spend. That was one of the things that we wanted to have in campaign was making sure that we are spending to the limit. So they'll get a budget up front. We want to make sure that that's tracking nicely to that budget.

There's obviously a lot we can do with the algorithm. But I think there's a lot we can do with alerting people to spend being a problem. OK, you're spend has slowed. Why is it slowing? Do you want to get in and have a look? Because there are factors that we may not have control over like it could be that it's been out of stock from the retailer's website for a while. But like, these are the sorts of things that we want to look into. Yeah, campaigns going dark. A long time [taken] to approve the campaigns. There’s little bits and pieces like that that we could help with.",Missed opportunity, Spend, Future opportunity, Bidding, Approvals, Optimisation,,,,,,,,
"And then there's those pieces around like bids. OK, you seem to be losing a lot. I'm going to either, with your permission, automatically up your bid so that you can start winning again within limits like. Because again, you don't want up the bid and then suddenly burn all their budget through. So it's all of those little levers that we're not good at, at the moment. We’re kind of just at a status quo and trying to trying to get by.",Bidding, Missed opportunity, Understanding vague, Automation,,,,,,,,,,
"So we've got a lot of stuff to kind of cap over-spend. You know, we've got our daily spend limits. We've got our total spend. We've got, you know, wallet pacing to a degree. It’s not working perfectly. So we've got a lot. And all of those strategies I say are to stop burning budget so that you don't have something just flies through and burns everything at once. But then we haven't focused enough on things that are not spending well enough. We've sort of said ""Yeah, cool. We'll make sure that you don't go over your budget"". But then we don't alert them when it's not tracking accordingly to the budget. And that's where managed services step in.",Overspending, Spend,,,,,,,,,,,,
"That's why they got all these crazy spreadsheets and why people like Clive from SmartFoods goes and creates crazy spreadsheets to get that visualization of like, is it spending OK? And if it's not, what do I need to do to get it to spend OK. They're doing all of that stuff outside of the platform now. So we need to be bringing that that sort of intelligence. So I had this vision of us sort of using even notifications as a way to go ""Hey your campaigns underspending here a couple of things you might want to do. You might want to add some products to your campaign. You might want to add some search terms to your campaigns. You might want to up your bids"". And then kind of tracking which decision they take out of our recommendations. Because those will be the main things, right?

Because we know that 80% of people when we tell them that they're campaigns not spending, they go on up there bid or they go on add more products from the same category out of their products.

"Hand-holding, and I think that could be part of our, you know campaign [improvement]. We want to try and take that hand-holding away. Like I think that is kind of one of the goals that we have. Like the Ad Op’s in the US is so over-resourced, it’s crazy. Because they keep blaming our platform is not doing the job that they need to do, right? And so, there's merit in it. And so that's why we need to work out. They keep saying to us we need bulk editing [for campaigns setup and optimisation] and we always believe we need to do bulk editing.",Guidance, UI improvement, Campaigns, Optimisation, Bulk actions, Business challenge, Managed service,,,,,,,
"So I think that's where this strategy is. Like, let's build out our API that will allow that and have them do it through other systems, and then we focus on other bits of pieces instead.",Future opportunity, AdManager, API,,,,,,,,,,,
"The other day, you know we when we're having the interview with Mike [B] and he mentioned the managed services does feel right is like up to 30 and 40% and without managed services is only like 10% or something. So that's the big, big gap considering, you know, just if we can just lift up that area more user friendly for them for them to be able to utilize the full strength of our platform that just like we see that gap is like 30% increase, right just with it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yes. And then that's the retailers’ point of view, right? It’s that again, for some of these smaller retailers, they don't have what they call category managers that like ""OK, you're the confectionery category manager and your job is to go out to Nestle and Cadbury and you know Byron Bay cookies and all of those guys and try and get them to come onto your platform and advertise"". And so I guess, yeah, that's kind of what the Retail Media Planner was trying to do and that's what the CSM’s understand, and the Ad Op’s. Well the Ad Op’s more so. That's their job. They become the confectionery category manager on behalf of the retailer. And they have to go and get the people.",Retailer Media Planner (AdManager), Categories, Nestle, Future opportunity, Retailers, Cadbury, Managed service,,,,,,,
"So there's also a lot of opportunity from that space where we could actually be saying to the retailer ""Hey, you're Fill Rate in the confectionery category isn't great"". We know that. We could also say things like, as benchmarking right ""We know that Cadbury have a lot of presence and spend a lot of money in this particular category. You should be going and speaking to them"". Like ideally, we could almost get Cadbury to do like if we could become almost like a publisher network where we say ""Hey Cadbury come here and we'll advertise on all these retailers"". We're not there yet, but there's ways that we could go and say to the retailer ""You're not getting as much money out of this category as you should. You should be approaching you know XYZ vendors or you need to have at least 2, 3, [or] 4 people competing in this space for it to be worthwhile"".",Future opportunity, Publishers, Categories, Fill Rates, Bench-markinhg, Retailers,,,,,,,,
"So there's a lot of that stuff we could do back to the retailer as well to help them sell their space as well. And the yeah, the Fill Rate type thing. Because that's what the Ad Op’s are doing. That's their job, to go out to those brands and say ""Hey, come and advertise on Target or come and advertise on goPuff"". But not all retailers have that that resource. And I guess that Tier 1, 2, 3 breakdown of retailers a little bit as well. Can they – similar to brands – can they afford managed services, or agencies to go and do their job for them, to bring brands to their websites, to have time.",Staffing or Resourcing, Tiers (customers), Fill Rates, Incremental sales,,,,,,,,,,
"It's high spend. So I've always had this theory that it's spend related, right? That is what the US Ad Op’s team delineate as self-services or like managed service. So obviously they're [managed services] employed by the retailer to get brands to spend on their platform. But they'll still have brands that they consider self-serve. So they push them off to the AdManager UI and they say ""Just go and create your campaigns through the through the UI"". So they sort of have that model already of like low spend goes through the UI, high spend come through us [the retailer or managed services].",UI, Managed service, Spend, Tiers (customers), Self-serve, Retailers,,,,,,,,
"And so we kind of almost need our tools and systems to emulate that in a way, right. But yeah, they're version of like a self-serve brand, which is kind of what not gearing as a Tier 3 brand is a spend that's less than say 25, 35 thousand U.S. dollars a quarter. And again, I think they've got 4 tiers because it's more to do with the service model, so it's a little bit different. I think we could keep ours in 3 tiers. But we're looking into the data to kind of almost validate their theory on that in terms of how they break that down from an Ad Spend point of view.",Spend, Data, Self-serve, Tiers (customers), Future opportunity, Future research,,,,,,,,
"I'm wanting to see what our three different buckets of Ad spend are, and kind of bucket them that way.

"So as I say, we've got this hypothesis that Tier 1 is predominantly managed service or aggregator or whatever. And then that might leak a little bit into Tier 2.

And so, Ad Spend, I guess is probably the biggest way to cut those through.",Spend, Tiers (customers), Future challenge,,,,,,,,,,,
"Well because they outsource everything, it's more about who they outsource to and making sure we're compatible with that. And we've also got to prove that we get return, right? So Criteo are doing some dodgy things to show that they do return.

And so it's making sure that, for those lower brands and the upper [ones, that data is explained].",Brands, ROAS, Agencies, Managed service, Criteo,,,,,,,,,
"Because I'm not saying that our UI would completely write-off T1 altogether [in terms of using the UI]. What I'm saying is we need to build a UI that is more for those Tier 3’s. And if there are elements of Tier 1 or even like part of their like strategy can be done through our UI, then great. But if we're trying to build a UI for all the tiers, we're going to end up in a like – we already are – in that space of, like not really pleasing everyone.",UI, Future opportunity, Tiers (customers), Customer needs, Brands,,,,,,,,,
"It's a weird correlation to make, but when I was in IT – multifunction centre that does scanning, printing and faxing – they never do a good job of all three, in my experience from a hardware point of view.

It's a similar sort of thing [in AdManager], you’re trying to please everyone, and you're never going to please them all properly. So you need to know what your lane is, and really focus in on that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And then their API should hopefully feel the other gaps, right? As long as our API… we need to still think of the Tier 1 use cases and build an API for it.

"That's funny that. Because that remind this morning Ollie we'll have that discussion about this feature, the banners diversity, you know, have the problem.

Yes. We need bounds [for scope and solutions]. We've been very boundless up to this point.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Thanks for Betty. Just put that in context. Like if we're trying to go after Tier 1. I was talking to Ali and in the States about the Heinz Kraft [account]isn't it for Target. And they currently use, I think it's 9 agencies in the US plus AdManager. And it said to Ali, if they had self-managed would they use us [our UI]. And she said ""No"". There's so much to do, they're [the brand] happy to outsource it because the volume of their inventory is absolutely enormous.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So even if we gave Tier 1's the best experience, they'd go ""Yeah, we still won't use it. We've too much on. We've too much market-share"". Like they're not going to replace 9 agencies and us in-house [resourced]. Because that's a huge amount of like an expertise uplift, if you were uplifting it in-house.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However, some of the things we do for Tier 3 will help our managed services. But Betty, you know this anyway, because we talked about the ecosystem research and we've we found it two key things. The two differences at our multi-sided market. So we have retailers and brands and then obviously we have customers who may or may not know we exist.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So the retailers want ROI. They absolutely want return of investment. So they want to fill stuff like they really want to kind of activate on AdManager and just fill it as much as they can and get the big revenue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The bit where off-site really plays for brands, is [they] want two things they want. They want sales, you know, so obviously the click-through rate sales. But the big thing that they want and the big thing that they can't get from all retailers, they won't accept acquisition of new audience, they're after brands are after audience. Like where’s that audience; where does it hang out; how can I develop the audience; how can I grow the audience? So the slightly different in their wants that needs, and that's why I kind of agree with Betty. We're kind of heavily on the retailer focus and we need to kind of come back to each other side of the multi-sided market and and look at what brands want. Because sometimes they're different kind of drivers and needs that they have.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"They don't. Well, they don't have a lot. And a lot of them …",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yeah. So it's interesting, I always call out the three key interviews in my mind. Don't know whether David you feel the same, but there was Narim [eComm & Marketing Manager] from Uni Co, Clive [Digital & Social Content] from SmartFoods. And always forget her name [Emma F Marketing Manager], but she was from Rondalla, which is like Better Pasta and Byron Bay cookies, and stuff. I guess SmartFoods is kind of what my stepping into Tier 1, but they were almost like my Tier1, Tier 2, Tier 3, right? And so the chick from Rinaldo has very limited budget, but if they can spend it well and if they get good return, then that budget could increase the next year. So the flip of it is like while our system is not spending properly.",SmartFoods, Uni Co, Tiers (customers), Budgets, ROAS, Rinoldi, Spend,,,,,,,
"And we also had someone who I think they were Tier 3 and they were like ""Oh we put the money on there and then we just let it spend. And we barely log into the system at all. And we just let it spend until it runs out"". Or there were certain people that were like ""Your system didn't really spend the way I expected, so I pulled it [budget] away"". We're not meeting the actual spend expectations. But there are situations where we might exceed them in those smaller Tier 3's. And then that gives them impetus to go back [to their senior managers or directors] and say ""Hey, look how much I spent or look how much I could have spent, you know, because this is how it was pacing and if you're project it out, I could have spent this much"" [and seen more sales]. And that's also what Ad Op's do, it’s like ""Your campaign's going dark [not serving] at 12.00 O'clock every day. If you gave us X amount of increment[al sales] then we would be able to then spend X amount more"". So they'll [Ad Op’s] often pitch for more money. Like they [brands] might have a quarterly spend, but they'll say ""This is spending so well, we're getting really good return and you [could] give us more money for this quarter or for the next quarter"", so to speak. So there's the flip of it is like, if it's understanding they've got to explain why versus if they capped out [their budget] and they had a lot more potential to spend, they can then pitch for more money.",Poor performance, Tiers (customers), Spend, Expectations, AdManager, Budgets, Pacing, Managed service, Business challenge,,,,,
"So if we can spend that Tier 3 money well, if we don't want to burn it. But if we can spend it well and show how to project [potential increased sales], that's a good way for them to pitch for the money. And obviously more money through the platform because they're doing well in return. They're getting the sales and so then they have more traction to be able to then spend more on advertising that if they keep showing more demonstrating that return.",Sales, Performance, Spend, Future opportunity, Tiers (customers),,,,,,,,,
Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yeah, and it depends on what their strategy is. So they generally and Katy [A] and her team have gone through this. There’s three main strategies I can never remember the third, but there's obviously just impression share, return on Ad spend [ROAS] and then there's a third one that I can't remember, but those are the two major ones. So when we're focusing on CTR, we're eliminating those people who just want to impressions [i.e. brand awareness]. They just want their Ads to be seen. It doesn't matter whether people click on it, or not. And that's the banner advertising, right? That's very much the impressions [strategy] – ""We're going to do fancy banners, we've got a new product and we want as many eyeballs on it as possible"".",Impressions, Managed service, ROAS, Awareness (funnel), CTR (Click Thru Rate),,,,,,,,,
"And so then CTR may not necessarily matter to them in those situations. So that's generally, new product launches or like SmartFoods spoke at one time where they dominated in the liquid breakfast market and then there was a big turnaround of that in like couple of years. There's been a lot more [competing brands] entering into that market. So then they had to really drive their liquid breakfasts and get their stuff being seen first and foremost, ahead of everyone else. And so previously their strategy was ""Let's just get some sales or let's just tick it away and let it just mull away in the background"". And then suddenly, they had to change their strategy real quick because they had a lot of competitors coming through. And so they had to put a lot of money towards driving it; have an impression-based and keep their name and their brand out there. So, it really depends on what's going on with their product in market too.",Promotions, Business strategy, Impressions, CTR (Click Thru Rate), Product, Sales, Brands, Competitor,,,,,,
"So that's in campaign. We're trying to really start focusing more on goals. And so we want to have some basic goals and see what's your strategy. Is it to gain more sales? Is it just to get your product seen? And then we can start hearing a lot of what we do towards their [brands] goals and their recommendations based on their goals. If their goal is to get impressions, we might recommend that they have a campaign with a lot of banner content or very heavily banner-focused, right? Versus if they want sales, we’ll be saying ""OK, let's try and get you everywhere on the retailer's website and no matter what, we'll put you in every placement or the placements that we know get good return"".",Business strategy, ROAS, Sales, Campaigns, Awareness (funnel),,,,,,,,,
"And so we're giving those Tier 3’s a disservice because we don't give any of that insight in that campaign creation flow. And that's why we were hearing for some of those ""Oh, we just put the money in there and just see what it does"" right or like ""I don't know what to do. So I just put it in there and I put it in on everything. And then I don't really know what to do with what comes out the back of it to make sure that it performing well"".

"Whereas Narim [in Uni Co] and Clive [in SmartFoods] are like, way ahead in that game. And they're like ""I need to change this bid; and move that bid; and change that spend; and move money from there to there; and make sure that spends"". And so they've got all of that. Whereas our Tier 3’s don't. And we're not helping them at the moment, which is really bad. But if we started to do some of that goal-based campaigns, you can see how Tier 2 and Tier 1’s might actually like that to potentially like ""Okay cool, you're now thinking like us, and so we can trust you a little bit more to spend our money properly"".

"So when you're thinking of the different needs of brand and retailer, retailer is very much inventory and Fill Rate. That's their main focus, right? They [retailers] need to have as many people advertising in as many spots and they need to have as much inventory as possible on their website without flooding the market too much. But that's their main thing is Fill Rate and inventory. Brand is like return on Ad spend [ROAS] or impressions. So retailers want to get as many people [brands] in there, and then the brands want to know that they're investment is worth it by being on the retailer's website. So they're the two different ways that we can focus on things.",Spend, Fill Rates, ROAS, Brands, Impressions, Retailers, Inventory,,,,,,,
"Retail Media Planner, I think is probably a little bit too complex for what it is. I think we've over-engineered something that is quite basic. They [retailers] just need insight into like where do I need to put like my energy in terms of which brands do I need to go after all where are the gaps [opportunities to sell Ad inventory].

So the fixed tenancy placements and how to fill those.",Insights, Retailer needs, Retailers, Inventory, Retailer Media Planner (AdManager), Placements,,,,,,,,
"[For] Auction, I think there's still benefit in kind of flagging with them where they might want to focus their energy. But actually creating [campaign] proposals and all of that sort of stuff for auction placements is not as critical to them because that's money that kind of just spends itself and that's our job to make sure that it spends itself. They [retailers] want to make sure that all of their fixed costs placements not getting filled as a priority.

"We're working through that. There's a couple of things. I just I just sent you a message. So there’s the ecosystem [research insights] stuff. There's the Dovetail insights. All that stuff that Betty talked about – all that stuff, and the strategy. Because how those how they run it is totally different to how like some of the brands would run on say Sainsbury's or Target. So yeah, we should go through that. And the mental models as well, because there's some contextual information here that might help the team. There's a couple of other bits of research we found [around] why brands are under spending. So there's a bit of additional information on top of what Betty talked about as well. Like the lack of notifications on the platform, and the pacing [of campaign spending] and all that. There's also a lack of digital literacy and knowledge as well, that's actually impacting on spend as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I hope it helped.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thank you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Any questions Fan, you've been very quiet.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yeah. I'm just wondering at the moment we are trying to optimize CTR and we are at the moment showing the Ads that we think has the higher click-through rate. But we're actually not differentiating between for, example showing women's makeup to you or to me. So we don't have the customer identification. Maybe if the retailers can tell us some basic information about this customer, we don't actually need to know the identity of the customer. They can anonymize them, but that can actually be helpful in terms of improving the CTR and conversion. Otherwise, we don't have very helpful mechanisms to improve that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yeah. So that was the discussion around like do we need to partner with people like Adobe. We need to work out what sort of CDP's [Customer Data Platform] our different retailers are using. So Adobe is a relatively big one. Because retailers are like extremely reluctant to give us data, no matter what. But as you say, it's trying to explain to them, we don't need to know who the customer is. I only had a conversation with Woolies [Woolworths ] yesterday about Adfluence. But I had to explain to them because I said Adfluence is like we don't care who the customer is. You work all of that out and then you tell us what you think this customer wants to see.",Retailers, Future opportunity, Data challenge, Adfluence, Adobe, CDP (Customer Data Platform),,,,,,,,

And they are they do not want to do that at all. They don't want to give away their cards [store and reward card info]. They don't want to give away their data. And so we've got to find a way where we can do that either through a middle-man or like saying we don't need to know who the person is. Just give us some of these like flags or indicators that we can use in in our relevancy or otherwise.",Customer needs, Data challenge, Future opportunity, Retailers, AdManager, Relevancy,,,,,,,,
"So I think Adfluence is starting that and opening that gate up. But we don't want to have to try and tailor that to every single retailer necessarily. So it might be better to start thinking about whether there's CDP [Customer Data Platform] platforms that we can start saying “OK, cool. Again, we don't need to know who the customer is, but just tell us what products they've bought before”. Or like this person is browsing… this random person under a session ID. We don't care. But we know that they buy L’Oreal makeup. So make sure that L’Oreal as a brand is very highly influenced in the in the algorithm. I think we can start having those conversations with retailers.

"So we've just got to do it in a way where we say ""We don't need to know who the person is, but we need to know what their propensity to buy is"". And so we need to work together on that.

And so I think they're open to it as long as we keep this whole “It doesn't matter who the customer is"".

"I mean like it's pretty close to the same, to be honest. We just have more retailers. We lacked effective product management essentially until Betty and David joined. I hope Adam never ends up watching this because he was here earlier. But we have always had retailers banging down the door and, I think we're all still familiar with them doing that. Our bills are paid by retailers, at the moment. So naturally we want to keep the bills getting paid. They still are. The US is a really interesting dynamic because we make money off the brands as part of our direct managed service offering. So retailers will negotiate us to the hard-line and similar.

"Or that much around how much they push brands. There's been a lot more market education that's happened. A lot of brands were on fixed tenancy models or similar and it's taken a lot of time to convince retailers and auctions are a better way. That's probably a bigger shift that I've seen because we spent a long time convincing retailers that auctions the way to go. Then we built fixed tenancy and did that across the US network, and now we're back on the auctions. But in terms of the power dynamic between retailers and brands, it's only really new.

Albertsons was very similar where they were like, you know ""I can give you suggested search terms. I've given you the suggested search terms. But you should be able to do this"".

"I'm actually curious, is there like a cultural divide that maybe like European retailers or Australian retailers are more cautious for his US retailers are more gung-ho, or is it is there no pattern there?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It damn good question. So only from our experience, the Woolworths and Coles are a great example. Where Woolworths will take forever to do it but they'll get it right and Coles will try to do it quick and do it in the same amount of time with a couple of stumbles. So in terms of you've been thinking retailers that actually are keen to do the development work for these extra features versus none.",Coles, Woolworths, Retailers,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yeah. So, like the ones that want to do everything like goPuff versus the ones that don't do anything and probably want to stick with fixed tenancy and ride that out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Personally, I can see less and less of the ones that want to do everything because it's work. You want a platform that just does everything automatically – as long as it does it right, which is the really hard thing. Because Criteo does everything automatically and then they get a heap of wrong matches. Like I think you might have value talking to like Cathy M [Senior Director, Retail Media Partners, AdManager] or someone on the Target side because we have a lot of people in the US that worked for Criteo. So they'll be able to talk to you about everything Criteo did wrong and how Criteo pisses off retailers. But I remember them talking about ""Oh, Criteo does all these automatic keywords"". And then they'll be on the phone all the all day to the tech team [in Criteo] like ""Can you quickly remove this one? Can you remove that one?"". So if it's good, it's good. If it's bad, it's bad.",Search terms / Keywords, Follow-up, Automation, Competitor advantage, Criteo,,,,,,,,,
"I'm just trying to think. So, trying to convince retailers to develop anything is work. You need to convince the value. Something like brand pages makes total sense. It's work, but the outcome is tangible, and you can see this. Suggested search terms is a really good one because it can drive a lot of outcomes, but it is a lot of data work to get right, test and develop. Now I love suggested search terms and the outcomes good when the retailer's good. But Ahold [Delhaize], for example, don't have it. It took us ages to talk Albertson's through it. It's a lot of client development and sales, convincing. To share that data, you need a team to talk to their data team like there's a lot of work in it.",Ahold Delhaize, Search terms / Keywords, Future opportunity, Data challenge, Retailers, Albertsons,,,,,,,,
"I'm just trying to think. Then we have a lot of the Tier 2 into Tier 3 retailers just aren't going to get there. Like ShopRite, Hy-Vee? Like it's arguably not really worth the squeeze for them, or we try and push them onto other placements or other capabilities that will make us more money.",Hy-Vee, ShopRite, Tiers (customers), Placements,,,,,,,,,,
"So you mean the opportunity, if we magically did it ourselves, somehow? We know it's ten years in the future, two years in the future. One of the biggest pains in the bum is [retailers] reviewing and then creating. So if you can show more search terms to campaigns, get bigger. If I as a retailer don't have to review every damn campaign and their selections, then you know it's easier on me. It's just easier revenue. I have less head count I need to hire – have less people that need to manage this system. And I'm also going to have less of that poor review person complaining that the system sucks.",Search terms / Keywords, Approvals, Future opportunity, Retailers, Manual effort,,,,,,,,,
"Again, not that our system sucks, but like thinking of Nectar and the fact that that have three people per day reviewing campaigns. Like they just get droned down on it [the amount of manual effort]. That makes life easier. The opportunity on the campaign creation side gets larger, assuming all goes well, and easier.",Campaigns, Approvals, Nectar360, Staffing or Resourcing, Manual effort,,,,,,,,,
"OK, so my question is what's the opportunity of growth? We move some of the retailers into Rev share. Our revenues more ties to their performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So if we move retailers under revenue shares instead of software as a service [SaaS], you mean?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"You going to put this into Dovetail and it's just going to say it just makes life easier. So I think everyone, at least on the product side, has been waiting on pricing or advice on pricing. We have three or four solutions which don't have pricing but are tech ready. So the reporting API is ready – like within reason there's administrative layers. But they're reporting API is pretty ready and good to go. Brand pages is pretty ready to sell at least. Retail media planners pretty ready to sell. If we have skin in the game, then we don't have to worry about up-selling retailers. You don't have to sell them as much. [It's] like use these solutions to make more money and we'll just take a cut of it.",Retailer Media Planner (AdManager), API, Brand Pages (AdManager), Pricing structure, Future opportunity, Reporting, Business challenge,,,,,,,
"So by having the incentive or skin in the game for the retailer to make money, we are more incentivised to give them ways to make money. So do we really need to govern, you know how much the reporting API costs? What package they're on or similar? Or do you just say ""Look, this is the limit you can have"". And they can use it to make more money by making the right decisions. At the moment, we've been moderately giving it away for free to retailers to stop doing file feeds. But we're stopping on brands.",Revenue, Data challenge, Retailers, Pricing structure,,,,,,,,,,
"I'm going to go sideways because I'm crazy. When you were asking about the brand-retailer relationship Ollie about two weeks ago, we had a call with Goodman Fielder and we were pretty transparent. We were like ""We have a reporting API. We just can't give you access, it's the retailer's data, or similar"". And they are at the size – funnily enough, these are the guys that sell Helgas [Continental Bakehouse brand] like the bread. But they're the size that they said, I'm just going to call them up every day until they say it's fine. I'm just going to be as annoying as I can until they say it's fine because we need this data to do better. So if we're in less of a road-block kind of position with our solutions – because it's like I said we've got so many things just sitting waiting on pricing or do we charge for [AdManager relevancy] adfluence, do we not? I don't know how many people were exposed to that, but we had two or three weeks of indecision there.",Goodman Fielder, API, Relevancy, Data challenge, AdManager,,,,,,,,,
"As soon as it just becomes part of platform, it's a lot easier to get retailers onto it because you don't have to spend time talking them into paying for it. You don't have to justify the opportunity costs from a we make 20 grand [$20k] from this. We will just make money from the outcome of you making money. And then if it's good then awesome. If it's not good, then we also have a bit of skin in the game to say ""OK, well, we got we got to make this better"". Instead of just ""Oh, well we delivered it. It's not our fault you're not doing well"". Did that answer any of it though?",Future opportunity, Revenue, Value-Add,,,,,,,,,,,
"No, that's really good. In terms of discussions towards moving retailers towards these like ‘we have skin in the game models'. Have there been any success stories of that?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It's too early to confirm. Woolworths only received it last week [the Rev share option]. You know you put forward a couple of options. You pay this much, or we get a little bit of [revenue] share over here, and you pay a little bit less monthly. And again, like none of this is really confirmed, but Peter S was actually quite surprised. He was like ""Rob [Odd] was actually pretty open with it"". Like it was one of those, like, not too bad because Coles initially – and I think still – are on just a flat fee. You [the retailer] pay for the technology. And they paid good money because they're finance team didn't want a variable model. It's just one of those ‘does not compute' kind of things. Like Coles just wanted this technology costs this much, and I can balance my books.",Contracts, Fees or Charges, Coles, Revenue, Woolworths,,,,,,,,,
"It makes it easier on the off-site side as well. So with off-site we make a larger share of revenue. But it's a revenue share model only, by my understanding. So it makes it a lot easier to say ""OK, well on-site we make this much of your revenue, and off-site we make this much"". Instead of, you know, you pay for this technology and all those kind of things. As we look into social [media advertising] and all the other things that we're not really doing or we're pretending that we're doing, it also makes it a lot easier to just say you just make a percentage. Instead of this 140 grand [$40k], this one 2%, this 180 grand [$80k]. It's just a lot easier to say we make this much.",Social media, Revenue, Off-site, Fees or Charges,,,,,,,,,,
Woolies would be the only success story I would know of because you only get to have these conversations at contract renewal. So it'll be a slow 3 to 4 year process [to change contract agreements]. But what we're hearing as well from higher up is that revenue share kind of makes sense.,Revenue, Woolworths, Contracts,,,,,,,,,,,
"Is part of the discussions with Woolworths was also partially like ""We have these new technologies now that we can both benefit from"". And that was part of the discussion. Or is it more so just it was just a time to come?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I think both. So Peter S has always been an advocate for revenue share. Because I've wailed on about it just makes sense. Our teams are incentivised for the retailer to do well – whether that's support, whether that's client success. Obviously, it's sales. But you're incentivised for the retailer to do well, because the business does well. I don't mean that in a personal incentive way. But like it, it just trickles back to, if the customer is doing well, the business is doing well. As opposed to the SaaS model, which is a little bit more like well, you use this much. Good luck. Again, did I answer the question though?",Business growth, Retailers, Contracts, Revenue,,,,,,,,,,
"No, you did. You gave us one [successful contract outcome, with Woolworths example]. And if there's only one, that's fine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Not much, to be completely honest. Not for years. There used to be a lot more day to day because I used to make the banner-X's for Coles. That was a unique time in my life. Not a lot now that our support team has grown significantly, which is a good thing like. That's essentially my answer, to be honest. Where were you looking to branch off to as part of those?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Good point. Good CSM coverage as well as global customer support. So my general dealing with brands would have been more on the what's wrong and now that we message it back to them. You're not winning, raise your bid to kind of responses.",Managed service, Support,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I mean, we're losing not a fair bit of business, but a lot of brands are going to Pacvue or similar because it's easier. Like AdManager's UI is really robust in the amount of targeting that you can do. But it becomes a lot of work if you're smart around how you do it. So I mean it will come no surprise like investment in good APIs or similar [is needed]. And your bigger brands like Pepsi or that will just build against the API. [NOTE: Pacvue's dayparting tool allows the user to increase or decrease bids on an hourly level. The user can automatically decrease bids during low traffic hours and increase during high traffic hours or during the holiday season.

What they've also done a good job of that our UI hasn't done is you pick which AdManager retailers you want. So I don't want to appear on AdManager, Target, AdManager, goPuff, whatever. So you don't have to log into a [AdManager] UI. You just load up Pacvue to say ""Give you the goPuff campaigns"".

"So how we see this relationship, you know, we competing and we're also work together.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Well, to be completely honest, Pacvue specifically smack talk us and our stability a lot. Which is rude. I'm not sure, Nick. I don't think from our side, we're never going to be pushing to our competitor Criteo. Like they sit in a bit of their own space.

Like there's a lot more to it behind the scenes, but the [Pacvue] management interface is easier because they've essentially built a UI around interacting with our system by API. So there are a good example of if we build good API's that other platforms can just feed into ours and do that. I don't know if we're ever going to be able to catch up to them, personally. Because they're already two years ahead [of AdManager]. And they do it across multiple other platforms. They connect to Google Shopping, Criteo, all of that. I just don't know if we're ever really going to beat them. We might. you know, not fix up a few things that make it easier for them to be less attractive.

"So how if you're using API, how we make money from it?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Percentage. And that's why it's not rolled out on Coles or Woolies, because there's no commercial agreement between the three of us.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
OK.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So that's why it's popular in the US. Because it's very easy because AdManager makes a percent [on the usage]. And how the conversation goes is ""Hey Target, I know we make…"". I don't know 12%. So I'm not sure if the numbers change on the retailer's share. But it's basically just saying ""Look, if you want to open up to Pacvue – and Pacvue already can just pitch it as we already have $2,000,000 [2 million] in Ad spend today or something – and you can just turn it on with AdManager. You know just activate AdManager, everything's already done in AdManager. Everything's already done. You just have to flick the switch and you make more money"". And then Pacvue says ""We make 8% of the Ad spend to put it through our platform"". But I don't think they're going away, but they'd still need us because they don't have an Ad serving technology. You know what I mean? Like they're a platform that touches Ad servers.",USA, Pacvue, Retailers, AdManager, Fees or Charges, Spend,,,,,,,,

OK. Have we done any analysis? Say which part make more money for us? Considering the cost like which one like more money?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Which partner?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yeah, like compare with Coles worries with the Pacvue type customer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I don't think we've ever done directing analysis because we categorise them differently.,Future research,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I was going to say Pacvue's still demanding. You just haven't had it filtered to you yet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
OK.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But that they're not too bad. I see what you mean to be honest, and it's another thing I was going to mention.

So said you didn't give a spoke to the brands in a while. But like what are the brands complaining about?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I mean, we have our customer satisfaction survey that we ran and that was, honest [feedback]. A lot of it is just how much work it is to manage. Campaigns not being campaign groups or things like that. Lack of bulk editing, [and] why do I have to pick every single thing? Why do I have to search for my products? Why don't you just know, based off a brand tag on my team or something – what all mine are. Why do I have to search for every single one instead of you just showing me? I know I'm Cadbury. Why can't your system know I'm Cadbury and just say pick from these 120 products? That's a pretty bad example because that's not what we're hearing too much, but it's more ""I have 20 campaigns to manage. I have to go in. I have to click edit on each one. There's no bulk interface or similar. There's no notifications. I got to log in every day to see how I'm doing. You're never emailing me, telling me what my Ad spend is. You don't tell me when campaigns stop. I just find out a day later that I'm out of money when I log in and check"". There's a lot of things going dark or it's hard to manage.

But would never really look too much into.",Notifications, Reduce effort, Bulk actions, Campaigns, Manual effort, Retailers, Brands, Guidance,,,,,,

"I would because your Ads aren't showing. And it's part of that FOMO [Fear Of Missing Out] reporting or similar. You're losing customers. But yeah, it's that kind of like how you by the way, you've stopped, go take a look at it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the big spend stuff… I have something recently I don't know if it came from Adam or Betty. It's our top biggest spenders by month and it I could send that on to the team. But I think in the top 10 is target nectar, Albertson's Ahold and HEB and Tesco's Coles, all Petco. They're all the top ten, but I think I already have that. And I could shoot that on to kind of show you which ones are spending the most and that kind of thing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yeah. It's something that's coming out of... I got 2 big reports.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Is it an Excel spreadsheet?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It is, yeah.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"I had 3 questions, but I think I'll ask them one at a time. The first one is in yourself in the CSM's dealing with the likes of forwards and Coles and those guys. What's the role of the role title of the person you're dealing with, and what's – on in average – their level of RMN competency and understanding?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Damn good questions. So before I answer them, if you do share that [Excel] sheet, it took an arm and a leg to get the profitability figures from finance and I think they'll kill us if we share them broader. If you have that version, so please don't.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But to answer your actual question. My first times in 2019 on Coles was actually with Narim W, who Betty likes to talk about now. She was activation manager or something back then, but her job was literally to monetise Coles and she was very well versed on it. I think one challenge we've always had is the Tier 1's. They essentially have an org [organisational structure] set up for this one person per retailer or more who are well versed in retail media. But anyone Tier 2 or Tier 3… it [roles and responsibilities] just trickles out. That would be my opinion.",Operations, Coles, Tiers (customers),,,,,,,,,,,
"One of the reasons Woolworths don't onboard Tier 3 suppliers is because the support load is greater than the Ad revenue. That was one of their feedback as well. It's that we can't scale your system without more people, both from Ad management and reviewing campaigns and being a CSM to brands perspective. Because everyone has to go do the analysis themselves. And this one was from way back in about 2020. But they said we don't onboard Tier 3 suppliers because they just don't understand any of it. It's a harsher curve to onboard them.",Woolworths, Tiers (customers), Revenue, Operations, Scaling, Business norm,,,,,,,,
"In terms of like amount of work to review campaigns, I think it's like one example right of like why you can't on board Tier 3 brands. What are the other reasons that like it's resource intensive?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Just so much. I mean, if your Cadbury, you're pretty well versed and I want to advertise Cadbury, If we're honest, a Tier 3 advertiser likely has a Tier 3 product. They're not that familiar with customers. You know you're trying to push.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What do you mean by Tier 3?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Big bigger to smaller. So we've got Cadbury [big brand] and we've got grandma's cookies [small brand]. I would consider it like. A Carlton Breweries is your Tier 1. They put 100 grand [$100k] into Dan Murphy's a month. And then this brand new brewery in Brisbane is finally listed on Dan Murphy's in their marketplace. So they put in their first beer into the market and they don't have that much marketing dollars. They might have $1000 a month or something. So they're not going to rank that high on the retailer side and they don't understand why when I'm bidding $5 a click or something, like why am I not winning? So it's a lot more support [needed] on like how can I do better?",Tiers (customers), Bidding, Cadbury, Carlton & United Breweries, Dan Murphy,,,,,,,,,
"Why am I not winning? But how do I make my product better? And some of that isn't even AdManager's fault per se. They just don't properly understand our retailers' sites work and what other things they could be doing?

Was insights focused on making it so that brands would understand how their campaigns are doing?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Insights as in our team?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"They focused on surviving men. To be honest we haven't ever had the capacity to do – through no negative ill will intended on the team – to do sufficient, you know, heavily heads down, how do we tackle this problem, kind of analysis. I mean like relevancy was a great one. Where you know, I mean, everyone just tackled down; had to look at the data; figured out how we could solve that problem.",Analysis, Business challenge, Insights,,,,,,,,,,,
"So we launched impression share in 2019. The little thing in the UI that says you know you have this many impressions and this is how many you could have had. It was a really basic formula, that is literally how many Ad requests did we get for these search terms or filters on the campaign. And filters bloats it out like crazy because we have a bunch of other filters on products. But it's never been modified or adjusted since 2019. So most retailers, we don't turn it on. Now as a metric, it's great. It's massive FOMO [fear of missing out] kind of metric on here is every single thing you're losing on. You're missing 2000 impressions a day. Or a percentage is better because it's a share of voice [note, percentage calculation is missing from the UI]. So you say you know like 70% of the time someone else is winning and getting your customers?

Thats Fill Rate.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Do have has kind of analysis in DataGrid?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yeah, I was going to say we definitely have Fill Rate in DataGrid. Because we never had a pricing strategy on advanced reporting because we don't have firm outline of how DataGrid looks in the future. We have a retailer dashboard that says exactly that. That's the Fill Rate dashboard [in DataGrid], but it's not rolled out to anything more than about 2 customers, I think. That's another thing. It's just shows [data]. Here's everywhere you should be focusing your time on advertisers. So a lot of things [problems to address] are just using what we have better instead of building new things.",Customer needs, Fill Rates, Pricing structure, Guidance, Complexity, Business challenge, DataGrid,,,,,,,
"I'd two more. I'll just ask one of the time in case we run out of time. It's in the ecosystem research the bit the brands [Tiers] 2 and 3 aren't spending is linked to digital literacy. So that's ""I don't know what I don't know. I kind of need some guidance"". And the other side of it is ""I can't really interpret the metrics, so I don't know if I should spend more, spend less and go dark if I spend too quick"". So there's a couple of things there. There's no one silver bullet. But again, I'm hoping to share all that [research] back to the context of that. Jimmy knows all is because he was in the interviews with us as well. So we've made [the findings] it very contextual in that. So just remind me to share that back with this group again in more detailed kind of terms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Jimmy, the second question I had was one thing that came out, that ecosystem was Ad diversity. Like it's not just kind of Fill Rates on sponsored Ads and that. What's the big blockers for retailers taking up more Ad diversity. I'm talking about the richness of the Ads, the amount of placement, so extending beyond sponsored Ads. And then obviously there's far reach stuff like off-site, which is the magical [fix all], social media and digital video and DOOH [Digital Out Of Home video], right – the nirvana of revenue. So are there any barriers on the retailer side that's stopping them moving into that adversity and revenue diversity?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Interesting you say that. Search and category cross-sell, for example, haven't performed that well because they're on a cost per click [CPC] model. It's interesting because I've always pushed more placements, but what we're finding is you get to a certain point where we need that cost per impression [CPI] for sponsored products? No, we definitely are seeing a saturation point. Nectars' [Nectar306] one of them where they keep putting Ads everywhere.

"One problem we have with banners – which some people will be traumatised by the last couple of months – as we tried to play with banner diversity. One problem we used to have was a campaign could would serve in multiple… I'm trying to think. We got a couple of things like for product Ads, for example, it's not too hard for a brand with relevant products to dominate [winning bids]. Because we don't restrict [Ads], you can only serve two per brand or something like that. Anyone who's aware of THE ICONIC custom endpoint we actually did once originally have a brand restriction where we'd only serve one or two products per brand to the retailer. And that's something we haven't really ever done as well. But in terms of more placements on a retailer, I think we're hitting a point where we're realising we're distracting retailers. I know [THE ICONIC restitution] it still lives in the code. I wish we could turn that [code] off and I wish we could turn the TechData [TD Synnex] one off.

"But my personal opinion, David, is that myself included, have been distracting retailers with new placements instead of getting them to monetise search better. Because we automatically say ""Awesome new placement. Can't wait. We'll put resources on it. We'll pay for on, you know; we'll put our people on it"". which costs money. Instead of just saying ""Your search saturations at 20%. Your money is on the table over there. You're just not chasing it. You're putting your dev team to do you know [other work]"". Which is great, because they're prioritising work in AdManager. They believe in us.

Just in in terms of that saturation. You're talking about getting more bid diversity to get a higher bidding pool per category or [search] term. You want more bidders and more competition in that pool?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yes, it's a big part of it, to be honest. Saturation starts at how much you've actually serving Ads on your top 500,000, 2000 or 10,000 search terms. Because it drops off pretty quickly, to be honest. We have the Fill Rate report in DataGrid [that shows thus]. A lot of retailers don't either don't know how to use it [achieving a good saturation point] or don't focus on that and want to hope that brands will fill it up themselves. Whereas if we're surfacing up [data and insights]… arguably not to retailers. If we're surfacing up what empty positions are on the retailer site directly to brands, maybe you don't need the retailer to do the work.",Saturation, DataGrid, Future opportunity, Ad serving, Fill Rates, Notifications, Missed opportunity, Search terms / Keywords,,,,,,
"Yeah, it's an interesting one because Alice [R - Director Client Strategy, AdManager] –  it's not Katy [A – Managed Services, AdManager], I can't remember in the Ad Op's team – they do that missed opportunity reports weekly. And that's exactly what they're doing. They kind of saying ""Hey, this stuff [empty placements] is just low hanging fruit is just sitting there"". But in some ways, we kind of need to find out where it is on the retailer [site] but not serve it back to the retailer who's already swamped, but serve it up as bid opportunities back to the brands.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I am trying to load up the Fill Rate report [in DataGrid]. I mean that would be my opinion to be honest. We're not filling up what we already have [current retailer placements] and we're focusing on going elsewhere instead. Because we have you missed opportunity [reports in DataGrid] like you said, but we're not focusing on that. We're saying ""Oh you know, put but probably is about $20,000 in development resources into launching a new placement"". And then we have commercial meetings around why it's not performing well.

"On this search term thing, I was looking at some discrepancies. Not necessarily discrepancies that how we calculate the top search term across all the environments.

While for this namespace – this retailer VP they just set up this year – and they don't have the data of this ‘chocolate calendar' from last year. And in the DataGrid reporting, we don't really reflect this kind of change – recent change – properly. While in the API they can query or whatever they want to do, when defining the top search terms of categories. This area is not very well utilised in the recording area.",Namespace (retailer setup),,,,,,,,,,,,,

"I will do my best, Ollie. I mean basically what this does with like, it looks like it's global [report], so I'm going to stumble my way through it. You have the search term and the Ad request. And really how many spots are you feeling and how many you're not. So we check how many times this has been asked for Ads, which is 13 million [example used in DataGrid report was for search term ‘milk' – with 13,176,793 number of Ad requests]. I changed my date range to the last 30 days. How many Ads were requested [for ‘milk' 143,596,711.00 Ads were requested]. So that's how many times someone searched milk [i.e.13 million] and that's how many Ad possibilities there were [i.e. 143 million], which is, you know, Max number of Ads 20 or something like that. Here's how many we served [for ‘milk' 41,249,651.00 Ads were served from AdManager]. We have something called capped number of Ads requested  [for ‘milk' 120,587,230 Ads requests were capped].

So this is how you suppress it back to normal [using Ad Request Capped Limits].",DataGrid, Ad requests, Retailers, Fill Rates, Placements, Ad serving, Follow-up,,,,,,,
"Realistically, as a retailer I should be caring a lot about how many spots I've filled. A lot of these are pretty good. You have competing products. You have some data. I don't know enough about that, but you really looking at things like Impressions versus Ads served or requested [shown in % Impressions vs Ads Requested column in DataGrid report as a percent]. Requested [Ad metrics] is probably what you want. But this report basically tells you where you're doing well and where you're not doing well so. For every time someone searches for milk, we have [in DataGrid report] seven spots that aren't being filled or 6.76 [DataGrid report showed Avg Spots Filled = 1.47 and Avg Spots Unfilled = 6.76]. That's what I'm saying we should focus on figuring out. How do you just get more people onto it [fixing the unfilled spots low metric]. Now this [DataGrid report] is global, which makes it hard, but it's taking its time [to load]. And some of these [search terms], like eggs, you don't have that many advertisers. But it's these kind of cases where there's an average of this many spots unfilled, where you say well, why are you doing new placements. You can probably just go get 30 grand [$30k] more from a couple of advertisers [to fill missed opportunities on current unfilled placements].",Reporting, Missed opportunity, Search terms / Keywords, DataGrid, Placements, Retailers, Fill Rates, Impressions, Ad serving,,,,,

"Diane V [Business Development and Onboarding, AdManager].",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yeah, they're the two were catching up with. We've got two of their interviews in Dovetail. But it'd be really good because I remember Rachel [Schwartz] and Rebekah [Davila] walked us through an actual DataGrid report, and what they pulled out of it. Like a really simple thing like Will suggested is we show impressions, but we don't so show share [Share Of Voice percent]. So what they [CSM's] have to do for the customers, they export that out of DataGrid and they put a calculation [for] that impression loss. How much of that as a percentage. And that's another thing that's stopping our clients [seeing missed opportunities] because they go ""40,000 or 140,000 impressions. Is that good or bad? Like is that a 10% share, a 50% share?"". And a really simple UI calculation we could do in the front-end say that's a share of voice you're missing – that's a 50% [Share Of Voice percent]. They're [brands] more interested not the amount of impressions but the share. So if we said there's a 40% share here, just waiting for you to bid on. And they go, ""Oh, that's great, because if I knew the percentage I'd bid on it. But if I just seen numbers, I don't know, is it 27 [thousand impressions] better than that 45 [thousand impressions] for that category or that search term. So we have Ad Op's in the States that manually work out those calculations and give them back to customers via DataGrid. And you think, why don't we just have that in the UI?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yeah, we could have in the UI and then you could even just simplify it down instead of giving them exact numbers. We just give them a rating from one to five of like, this is a pretty good search term to bet on. This is probably not a good one to bet on.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Absolutely. I mean, how good would that be Will?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"So the most basic one and this one is almost it's kind of getting sunsetted out because I'm building something else, but this is like a quick hit, basically like the quickest hitter that the teams that the teams use to see their basic inventory KPI by product type by banner acts and then SPA and then they can also use it if they needed to compare it to others. So if I'm just looking at this past month. And I'm looking at a whole versus Albertson's. You know. Very slowly filter and it'll just show me like the the quick hit. So I'll hold the only one that actually has like banners for, so I can't compare, but I'm looking at my fill rate which is like or myself through rate those are, you know, synonyms that I that that we use as well as the render rate, which is important for me to track. Because it's telling us and it's so that I can tell the client how viewable the inventory that they're even given us, giving us even is if the client is or especially at a lower tier is giving is put their slots either banners or SPA positions so far down the page that we fill it 100%, but the render rate is only five. I'm going to turn that around to the client. Tell them immediately the potential revenue of your money is probably a million, but because it's not viewable, we're only able to make $10,000. This is an important metric for us to look at and then same, obviously would go you know just at the CPC level what's going on here. But this is so this is like a nuts and bolts super quick high view. If somebody just wanted to just look at the basics like there's nothing specific here, we're not looking at placements, we're just looking at the whole site. This would be like my very first view.

"Petco's was very responsive positively to all the insights that we laid out in front of them, including render rate for example or and the same goes for a hold their banner. For example, if you have a banner at the bottom it's 3% viewable and the render rate is going to prove that you know to me and it's going to show them. So it's fuel for them, cause usually who we're talking to, they don't, they don't get to touch their site, they don't get, they have to go through all their other channels and prove that in order for it to make more money and and that it won't drift, disrupt the user experience that that banner needs to be higher up on the page. So we're basically providing them with the fuel that they need to have those conversations with the rest of their team.

"So this one we built this year, this is the keyword discovery. So this is, it's we we worked on this first because obviously the bread and butter of our business is SPA. The majority of all SPA placements like volume wise revenue wise comes from a search page because that is how a user especially on grocery stores operates unless we're talking about target or Walmart, they are not navigating organically on the site to look at category pages. So we're making the most of our money on keyword discovery on keywords. Excuse me. So that's where my team focused a lot of their time this year. So this is an extremely valuable tool for our team and it let’s them look at these keyword these keyword opportunities that my team has categorized manually for the last year.

That should be a brand. But if international delight was here and buying that they're not buying their, they're clearly not buying their own inventory and they could if they, especially because international delight has a plethora of SKU’s. So if they had a new SKU and they wanted to boost it, they should be buying their own keyword and we can show them right away. Nobody is buying and you're not buying your own keyword, so you should go ahead and pop in there. But let's say we wanted to see who might be. I'm just going to do a specific keyword here.

"Right now I'm seeing in the last 30 days there's been 7 distinct suppliers and about 17 different campaigns or line items competing. When I go down here, I get to see who those suppliers are that are actively bidding for this for coffee right now and who's winning and why. If someone’s not winning all the way down here, it looks like it's because their Max bid is not good is not competitive especially versus Kraft and Nestle like Nestle wants to win. They're putting in a min bid of 250. How Califa Farms is never going to win, and we know that now because I can see right away that their min bid doesn't like, doesn't even come close to Nestle's Min bids. So they're not going to be the they're certainly not going to be the first considered or the 1st to or to, you know, winning in the top slots. So the CSMS and the sales use this as fuel and we the best we can do especially for the self serve is they try to inform the self, serve how you're not winning because they're only using the min bid like this guy a $0.75 minimum but we're all you know we can only tell them that we can't change it for them. So they do their best with the self serve brands to at least give them this information.

If you're not delivering, we need to find more keywords or the keywords for fly wheel for Nestle that are working and try to increase the bid so that they'll so that they they'll win more because clearly it it's more interactive for other keywords than this one might be.

But that is a straight assumption and the other thing too is even if we did, even if we did find out that the client won at position one, the I think the way we're set up is that Ahold could deprioritise and then put them in the position three suddenly. So that that's that is something that they if they could bid on it and like bid higher they would certain ones would for sure do it. It'd be very also very interesting and easier for me to do analysis and recommendations on what the best positions are in the grid to bid on, because sometimes position 5 is actually pretty good, like the 2nd ROAS, but I can't really verify that with our system right now since we don't have it set up that way.",Understanding vague, Ad serving, Bidding, Limitation, Placements, Ahold Delhaize, Advice and guidance, Brands, ROAS, AdManager,,,,

You know, it's more or less 0 is the first position that we have on there and down I can't. I can only see impressions and clicks so that that gives me some direction for them. So we do a little bit of analysis for the client like the actual account, the sales, the sorry, the retailer to show them that. But we don't send that to suppliers.

"So the rest of this dash is like it's just more ways like this is essentially the supplier by keyword is just another way for them to see. You know how much? Who's winning? And in this category of keywords. So in this case, like I can tell right away impressions wise, I could do it ad served wise. I just chose impressions, but you they can just see quickly how they're winning and they sometimes they export this and black this out and send it to their supplier so that they can see.

Or if you just wanted to compare ‘coffee’ versus all the other retailers you can do it this way. So that's very bottom. So this one [KW Discovery dashboard in DataGrid] is definitely is used quite a bit for different reasons. Campaign managers use this, traffic uses it sales, uses it, and certainly the yield team uses it. And you can see we got banners too. We don't really use it that much. We don't really bid that way. Like it's there if they need it and they want to see it.

"And the next that we use are bench-marks. This is more of kind of a placeholder in my opinion, since we kind of yield this, I like to call US analytics light. We do our best, but we're not as diving deep into the into the information as Mike Galovic's team does. So the best we can do when we're we've been asked to provide like bench-marks is inventory benchmarks like performances on how on the inventory itself and we do it in two ways. There's two different benchmarks. There's the keyword benchmarks. So same thing that we saw before based on like the keyword discovery. So keyword, like performance on the keywords and then the category placements. So it can only so we can only see it based on if a if a client has given me their category ID, which again the same as I know we have category label in DataGrid, but it's kind of a mess. So yield went ahead and we did our own. We manually mapped the ID and then we feed it into here so that we can see, but they're separate so it's not the end. All be all the best way to really do bench-marking. To share it like to show a client like to show Dunkin how they're doing compared to all like is to look at all of the coffee vertical programs through for the whole website.

"I'm just going to pick ‘coffee’ again [Keyword Category Benchmarks dashboard in DataGrid]. So if you go down here and I can pick here the impression. I pick ‘beverages’ and it'll change everything.

So we can see how what the average click through rate [CTR] is, how it's performing. The conversion rate [CVR] is standard [only on-site data].

Again, the ROAS over time take that with a grain of salt. And CPC or CPM, depending if we're looking at banners. In this case, we're just looking at SPA.

"And so this is the same thing [Category Placement Benchmarks In Progress dashboard in DataGrid] I'm still working on this now because doing the category ID’s manually took a long time.

Versus this is not as useful, this dashboard, for a grocery store, because we'd make far less money on category pages. We just don't navigate that way. But we did build this because there was a definite need for the Petco's and the Targets and probably Sephora [personal care and beauty products], if you were trying to think about this for other clients. This would be a useful kind of dashboard to look at. In a perfect world I would want to scrap these [individual DataGrid dashboards] completely and meld with the analytics team to make a fully-rounded benchmarks based [reporting] on the vertical or the type of campaign. All coffee campaigns, what are their benchmarks.

"Yes. I've been building this out [showed the Placement Type Report Ads Requested dashboard in DataGrid]. We have like all these placement cards in here too.

So here's product for Ahold [27:17 in video]. So here's search. So in this case this one is 40% [27:27 in video]. And this isn't revenue, this is the number. So 40% of the Ads requested is coming from search followed by PDP. I don't have revenue in this one [DataGrid dashboard] right now, Nick. So but this is basically what I how I would do it.

Are being tested, and if you're on the yield dashboard when you go there like there in the appendix right now, because I'm still like working on them. But this placement type report, Nick, is what it is. What me and the leads use this to Ollie. They they use this one a lot again. Like if it's not all leads, it's like only leads that are really tuned in to to understanding their inventory and working with their client will utilize this. So only kind of only a handful go into this on their own, but this is the basic table that I'll just kind of refer to it. I just, especially if I'm just looking for a gut check, looking at, looking at the inventory and looking at the revenue that's that's being brought in by Ahold by placement type.

If we're lower on their Ad stack and they have all these other things loading too, because they're partnered with other vendors. and we're the lowest on the stack then the impression might not get called even though it was going to be in-view. Like maybe there could be some sort of really slow in that waterfall, so that could be a challenge as well.

"This one is a doozy. This is the best, the best we can do so far for SPA forecasting, I wanted and Peter [Ilic, AdManager] knows this. I wanted to make a calculator on DataGrid. It was a little cuckoo pants trying to figure out, so we built like a temporary one that we put that, you know, we extract it from here and put it and dump it into an Excel template. We ended up keeping that for a couple reasons. One is we're always going to have a saved record of whatever we pulled for DataGrid like that day. That's like today to just in case we ever needed to reference it, or if we're six months down the road and they want to pull it again. I'm going to utilize what I pulled last time, but also and see how close I came to my forecast. Make sure they're delivering what I said they would be able to deliver. So this dashboard is evolving, but essentially this whole card though it's messy. Ahold in all, and this is the one utilizes top 6000 keywords per retailer at any given time, not and it's all this is an all time keyword. This is the data set that yield made in response to exactly a year ago, losing, you know, some data and this is helped us. This is very helpful data set and uses. It utilizes all time in monthly chunks as we don't really need to see day-by-day, but after a certain point. So they pull this in. There we're doing salty snacks. I want it for them.

In theory, sales for what I'm what I'm told is sales should be doing this, but this is an awful lot of detail that I don't personally think sales should be responsible for, because they're not. They don't live in the inventory all day. They're their job is to sell and my job is to assist them to sell. So this is this is the card. It gets dropped into here and it gets updated and anything yellow they get to adjust. So for a 15% twelve month, 15% share of voice for these search terms alone. For all of these, they could, they could serve. Or I'm telling them that they can sell in our an IO for 116K [$116k USD].

"So this calculator is basically telling them that anything they adjust in the yellow – is what I'm telling them right here – is at 15% share of voice [SOV Goal] projecting out for the next 12 months. This [$116k USD] is the projected spend that this client whatever I'm pulling it for could bring in, could serve with all of these keywords [displayed in DataGrid in the generic_search_term section]. Let's say I had snacks [keywords] taken out, if I added snacks in it becomes almost 200K [$200k USD]. So this is the best way that we can do a forecast. Now the only thing that this forecast is missing is what's already sold. But that's why we utilise keyword discovery. If this is for Dunkin, for example, I'm going to go into Dunkin in the last 30 days [in DataGrid] and look at coffee and see was 100% sold out? Nope. It was only 50[%].

"I mean, it really depends what ‘ask’ comes in. A lot of times, especially in the last two months, I've been tasked with a lot of FY24 full-year for all of these suppliers and all of these different brands.

OK, good job. You did spend 50K last year and based on what I'm seeing in the system, you can actually spend 150K [$150 USD] next year. So for a little bit of prospecting, if it's a brand; could be a brand new RFP that's coming into us; could be any situation. That's also why I've done in the dashboard [SPA Forecaster in DataGrid] I've done generic things like just soda [category filter] without knowing who the soda product could be yet.

"I'm going to kind of jump back and jump forward. I'll go all the way back to what you said is the start. I'm really interested.

"So I think it, I think it depends a little bit on the client, but from what I'm what I've seen with the campaign managers and the CSM, it's weekly, they're going is the especially the ones that that really that are the biggest or the ones that are brand new and are struggling and we want to make sure they're winning, they're in it every week. Looking for ideas, especially if they're hand-in-hand. They might also be looking at the campaign managements pacing report and if the pacing report is telling them immediately that they're under delivering, they're going to head to the keyword discovery and see if they could pull anything out of there.",Brands, Search terms / Keywords, Reporting, Business challenge, Campaigns, Pacing, Managed service, Missed opportunity,,,,,,

So that would be one of their arguments on why they don't want to. The argument against that would be, especially if you have one, you have a lot of products and you're trying to. You're trying to promote a specific one, or if you're Gatorade and you have a brand new flavour and you're trying to increase sales for the new red, white and blue flavour, then you need to be bidding so that it's to make sure that it's going to be in the top position.

So we saw it on a product, it was a dish type of product over here in Australia where the retail was about 30, but their bill was 50, like way above everyone else. And I kind of wanted to ask around if that kind of happens on second prize bid in and under the brands.

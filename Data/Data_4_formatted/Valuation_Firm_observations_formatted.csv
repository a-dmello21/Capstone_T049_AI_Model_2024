"Participant's view was Desktop valuations were capped at $1.5 and would escalate an order to a physical valuation, saying it was ""pretty black and white in that respect"".",Escalations, Desktop Valuations,,,,,,
Participant was surprised banks were ordering Desktop valuations above $1.5m.,Valuation Orders, Banks, Brokers, Lenders, Understanding Unclear,,,
"I think that's just a lack of understanding where the agreements [between banks and valuation firms] currently sit.
",Understanding Unclear, Standing Instructions, Banks, Valuers,,,,
Was asked if valuers may receive an estimated order below $1.5m but in their estimation it may go above this threshold. Participant responded: Thought the issue was straightforward and there were guidelines and agreements to follow for order valuation at certain thresholds.,Business Practice, Valuation Orders,,,,,,
"Again, we're not suggesting that that's, right or wrong. That 1.5 million. I think there's an opportunity to have a really close look at that. However, it's as I've said, it's really black and white. 1.5 at the moment, is the cut-off for Desktops. If they are being ordered above that, then they'll automatically be escalated.",Valuation Orders, Expectations,,,,,,
"If their [borrowers] estimate is 1.4 [million] and the reality of the value is somewhere a lot higher than that, then the same thing will apply.",Escalations,,,,,,,
Commented that the role of sense-checking the valuation outcomes above $1.5m and estimated values close to the threshold fall on the valuer (and not the valuations ordering team within a valuation firm).,Valuation Orders, Habits and Routines, Prep Work, Valuers,,,,
Commented the only escalation path for valuations over $1.m is a full inspection.,Escalations,,,,,,,
"I'm of the opinion that there is a role for these Desktops - not at any level - but certainly at a higher level. But if you're at a lower level and it's a really unique property, in a suburb where the highest sale is a million dollars, sometimes a Desktop isn't appropriate. It very much is on a case-by-case basis.",Desktop Valuations, Unique Property, Challenges,,,,,
"From the survey participant listed unique or unusual properties, old images, properties where there has been renovations or improvements and missing images or attributes as key reasons to escalate a Desktop to a Full valuation.",Escalations, Unique Property, Habits and Routines, Attributes, Photos, Renovations or Improvements,,
Did not know the exact figures around the individual escalation reasons but commented that escalations were only between 10% - 15% of all Desktop valuations.,Escalations, DeskTop 1.0,,,,,,
Commented that renovations or property with improvements could not be properly served by Desktops.,Renovations or Improvements,,,,,,,
"You'd be amazed how often we do a full inspection, and we find there's a bathroom being renovated, at the time. And we go back to the bank and we mention the bathroom. And they say 'Oh god they didn't even tell us that'. Or a kitchens been renovated, or those sorts of things.",Physical Inspection, Owner-Occupant,,,,,,
Felt that discovering these renovations in progress or something unusual at a property gives comfort that they are adding value and doing a good job on behalf of the bank. Describe it as being 'the eyes and ears of the bank'.,Physical Inspection, Renovations or Improvements, Challenges,,,,,
"Commented that on past occasions the lender could write whatever they want on the loan application, and a valuer might have taken that as truth when previously doing a Kerbside valuation.",Loan Application, Lenders, Borrowers Estimate,,,,,
There are challenges around valuing properties within specific suburbs and postcodes.,Location or Postcode, Challenges,,,,,,
There are also some complexities in conducting valuations based on risk factors.,Risk or Impact,,,,,,,
There are also unique outliers that turn up around unique properties sitting in an area where the median price of properties could be at a lower level. This can cause a 'red flag' risk if an owner spent a lot more than the median price for their build.,Unique Property, Property Value, Risk or Impact, Owner-Occupant, Location or Postcode, Challenges,,

"It's so commoditised [with valuation ordering]. It's insane how commoditised we've become. We would so much prefer to do things differently.

Then that's what we'd like to do.",Valuation Orders, Costs, Challenges, Change or Disruption,,,,
"Asked about barriers to performing more Kerbside valuations and commented that desktop valuations have been reduced to a cheap monetary exchange. So cost may be a factor, but kerbsides would be cheaper than a full valuation.",Opportunity, Kerbside Valuations,,,,,,

"We think, to be honest, that a Kerbside will be quicker than a Desktop in a lot of respects. Because the valuer, when they're there... there's just a different level of confidence that exists if they're actually at the property.",Opportunity, Kerbside Valuations, FOLLOW-UP,,,,,
"Kerbsides could be quicker and more cost effective than Desktops in terms of non value-based queries that occur, as well as value-based Desktop queries and escalations to Full valuation where lender do not get the outcomes they need to progress a loan decision.",Opportunity, Kerbside Valuations,,,,,,
"Assessment of apartments can also be challenging for Desktops, as valuations can be affected based on a favourable or non-favourable view within apartments within the same complex or building.

"Participant spoke about unique property examples like over-capitalisation, or a unique construction or build.",Property Value, Risk or Impact, Debt, Construction Build, Unique Property,,,
"We as an industry, I think have had to get our heads around Desktops, and their role in the industry. And for want of a better term, to remove the insecurities around Desktops taking over the role of a full inspection. I think that's played out in the last 6 to 12 months particularly. Given the resourcing issues that exist. So, I think we're better at it [using Desktops] as an industry. But there's probably still some education that needs to happen with the valuers. With some specific valuers who tend to escalate [from Desktops to Full valuations] a little too quickly.",Concern or Worry, Desktop Valuations, Escalations, Change or Disruption,,,,
Concerns in the industry have been around change that could impact on income or livelihood.,Concern or Worry, Change or Disruption,,,,,,
"The valuation industry has been slow to embrace change.

Need to dig into this further in terms of how it would affect valuers and an ethical research approach if MarketValuer were advocating for this in terms of impact on valuers' livelihood and income.,Risk or Impact, FOLLOW-UP,,,,,,
Participant commented that the industry is in a period of transition and was also thinking about what role valuers will have in this change.,Change or Disruption, Challenges,,,,,,
"That's red flag everywhere. They'll [valuers] just elevate risks. The valuers are salivating over that sort of stuff. I mean, it makes the job more difficult. But, they'll just be highlighting that and reporting it back in the strongest of terms.",Risk or Impact, Physical Inspection, Renovations or Improvements, Valuation Reports,,,,
"Commented that when the valuer goes back to report a renovation to the bank (and seek advice on how the bank wants to proceed), and a normal response from the lender is they were not aware a renovation was in progress. Banks will then need to seek some information from their borrower around builders' quotes, etc. In this instance a valuer may be instructed to do an 'as if complete' valuation on the property.",Renovations or Improvements, Valuation Reports, Value Add, Physical Inspection, Challenges, Documentation,,
"Noted that an in-progress renovation and as if complete assessment can impact the overall valuation. Depending on the size of the renovation, the valuation may become a construction valuation - with more complications for the lender.",Challenges, Physical Inspection, Renovations or Improvements,,,,,
"Property owners/borrowers do not always have correct, or any, building permits or town planning for their renovation and this can cause issues with a current loan application and valuation. This commonly occurs when property owners attach an outdoor room to their property. For example, owners put a shelter and walls over a deck, and add fire-pits and enclose the area.",Physical Inspection, Owner-Occupant, Building Permits, Risk or Impact,,,,
It opens up a whole raft of different things. And we have seen all of those scenarios play out.,Physical Inspection, Risk or Impact, Renovations or Improvements, Building Permits,,,,
Commented that valuers are the eyes and ears of the lender to help highlight any risks and issues on a property.,Risk or Impact, Physical Inspection, Valuers, Value Add,,,,
Asked if valuers ever receive any development application (DA) data on a property prior to an inspection. Responded that this generally does not happen. But added that receiving DA data before an inspection would be helpful.,Needs and Wants, Development Planning, FOLLOW-UP, Opportunity,,,,

"Commented around valuers' fears that were present when Desktop valuations first appeared in the market. Valuers were worried that Desktops would take over and all valuations would take place at the back-of-house. Valuers initially pushed back on Desktops. But, these fears have somewhat subsided.",Valuers, Concern or Worry, Change or Disruption,,,,,
"Asked if nervousness around Desktop and industry changes were based on employment and income, or having surety that Desktops would be as accurate as physical valuations.

"There's an element of, 'Is my career secure, and is my income secure?' And then secondly, they're going 'I'm not really that comfortable'.

All valuers use tablets and use the CBRE TOPS system to complete a physical valuation. Use tablet camera and an in-built measuring device that synches up with the TOPS system.,Habits and Routines, Valuers, Digital Tools,,,,,
High on wish-list was a mapping tools to use on inspections where a valuer could stand outside a property being valued and have a mapping display of all sales within the proximity of the subject property. This would allow valuers the ability to plot an overlay and radius of comparables in a mapping tools. This would help make valuations inspection much more efficient.,Needs and Wants, Opportunity, Areas to improve, Digital Tools,,,,

"Asked about lender frustrations with valuation delays. Commented if the banks' customers are willing to give access and are available, then there shouldn't be any valuation delays.",Areas to improve, Delays, Frustration,,,,,
"The problem over the last 12 months has been resourcing. As an industry, hopefully we've responded to that better than others. The sheer volume of work has meant that valuers should be booking for the next day. And unfortunately, it's been situations where they're booking 3 and 4 days in advance. And like, 3 or 4 days where you're looking for some money or looking for an outcome is sometimes too long. The banks then have to go through their process so it's a bit drawn out.",Challenges, Delays,,,,,,
Commented that CBRE have ideas around a better solution to alleviate some of these delays.,Opportunity, Delays, FOLLOW-UP,,,,,
"Commented they hear about a lot of frustration experienced on the lender side, noting that the post-valuation query process is a draining process - both on the lender and the valuer. Non value-related queries can be admin related that could be fixed by the lender before they get to the valuer.",Pain Point, Valuation Queries, Frustration, Time and Effort,,,,
Value-related queries requires responses and comments from the valuer and noted that valuer are not usually that keen to change their valuation figure.,Valuation Queries,,,,,,,
Commented that lender find it frustrating when 2 separate valuers (or valuation firms) go to the same property within a short space of time and their valuation figure can be significantly different.,Assessments, Frustration,,,,,,

"I think that's a frustration that I can completely understand. I don't know what the answer is to that. But that causes some angst within the banks, I think. And then it creates perception around 'Ah, these guys are conservative for this bank', and none of that exists.",Frustration,,,,,,,
"That's just the nature of the business. It comes down to a persons view of both that market, and how they've interpreted the sales. And the other reality too is some valuers are conservative; other valuers are bullish. Again, it comes down to a lot of different factors.",Values and Beliefs, Assessments,,,,,,
Where queries come into the valuation firms from a bank they are managed through their internal systems. Work is allocated per suburb to specific valuers. Their internal system has rules around suburbs serviced and valuers nominated to specific suburbs.,Business Practice, Valuation Orders,,,,,,
"Our strength is we are able to keep valuers in tight geographic areas. And the jobs, as soon as they get logged into our system get directly allocated to a valuer who's nominated to that suburb.

And if it's black and white and like I said if it aligns with the credit decision at the back end. There's so much grey in the valuation report.

And sometimes valuers will get to the orders first.,Valuation Orders, Booking Appointments, Business Practice,,,,,
"Orders come through the main WPB system and depending on the information and valuation or property type, orders will automatically flow through to valuers or get held in a queue for someone to first review the orders and manually allocate. The WPB ordering workflow system also uses rules to help with allocations and assigned. Additionally, some jobs will go to the customer to book as well.",Business Practice, Valuation Orders, QA,,,,,
Asked about lender and broker frustrations in valuation order delays. Responded there are usually always delays in valuations - especially for physical inspections.,Frustration, Delays, Lenders, Brokers, Physical Inspection, Valuation Orders,,
"Most of the valuations we do we have to get physical access to the property. So, there's always a delay there.",Physical Inspection, Delays, Booking Appointments,,,,,
"There's so much work around at the moment. Most of our valuers are probably booked today, tomorrow and Wednesday. So we're probably scheduling inspections in for Thursday at the moment. So when we call the customer [property owner], if the customers not necessarily available when we're available on the Thursday it could potentially be booked in for the Friday. Everyone's busy I guess.",Booking Appointments, Challenges,,,,,,
Also commented on valuation report queries raised by lender or brokers can also be impact on turnaround times on responses where a valuer may be out on a physical inspection.,Valuation Reports, Valuation Queries, Service Levels SLA, Physical Inspection,,,,
Commented that valuers generally do inspections in the more and focus on completing that report before addressing other valuation report queries from lenders and brokers.,Valuation Reports, Valuation Queries,,,,,,
"My advice always is that brokers and lenders need to get the valuation request into the system as soon as possible. I guess often we are finding that we are getting a valuation request a week before the property is due to settle. If we've got access issues with a tenant or a real estate agent, or a home owner, and we've got valuers already booking a couple of days ahead... then you're always running the risk of getting into the property on time. And getting the valuation back in time.",Valuation Orders, Service Levels SLA, Booking Appointments, Owner-Occupant,,,,
Follow-up discussion on transparent message and indicator on turnaround times for valuation orders as well opportunity to provide contextual message to lenders and brokers on potential delays.,Communication Tools, Valuation Orders, Service Levels SLA, FOLLOW-UP,,,,
"Commented that other delays can be a result on the banks credit approval process on their customers. Sees this as out of the control of valuers and, also commented it was not a seamless process - noting 'we're just part of that process'.",Delays, Banks, Credit Risk, Challenges,,,,
"Asked if lender or brokers are aware of valuer lead times for booking jobs. Commented they should be aware of general lead times - for example, 3- to 4-day turnaround on orders.",Valuation Orders, Booking Appointments, Service Levels SLA, Challenges,,,,
"I think most brokers and lenders are generally aware. And we do get requests, reasonably shortly after the property's sold. But often there's a file which will come through and for whatever reason it's taken too long to get to the valuation firm and then, all of a sudden everything's overdue and delayed, and urgent. And I guess as a val firm everything's urgent so it's really hard for the valuer to put one file [order] over another file. Really, we're just trying to book everything in as soon as we can and get it back [to the lender].",Urgency, Valuation Queries, Challenges,,,,,
Items that cause delays in property access includes getting access to rental properties with tenants. Requesting access can require going through a real estate agent who is managing the rental property. Some agents require valuers to apply for access in writing and this is turn is sent to the tenant (in writing) for approval to gain access to the property for 48 hours in advance.,Delays, Booking Appointments, Agents, Challenges,,,,
Contacting property owners can also be problematic where people are busy and cannot always take phone call while at work if in meetings or engaged.,Owner-Occupant, Booking Appointments, Challenges,,,,,
Commented that refinance loan valuations are generally the easiest as property owners are usually living in their own property and booking access is less of a challenge. Homeowners are usually incentivised to provide access as soon as possible to get to a loan decision sooner with their lender.,Refinance Loans, Booking Appointments, Owner-Occupant,,,,,
Also commented that booking access to a property has been generally easy for the past 12 months as more homeowners have been working from home due to COVID restrictions.,Booking Appointments, Owner-Occupant, COVID,,,,,
Real estate agents who recently have sold a property - subject to finance (for the buyer) they're the easiest as they have a real interest in getting us into the property as soon as possible.,Agents, Valuation Orders,,,,,,
Outside of access problems there can be delays due to valuer schedules as they have booked diaries they are working out of and trying to line up new jobs with.,Delays, Booking Appointments, Challenges,,,,,
"Asked about responding to urgent valuations. Responded they the valuation firms see all jobs as urgent and get treated equally. Noted that most files coming from lenders and brokers are marked as urgent, and it's almost become routine for the lender or broker to mark something as urgent.",Valuation Orders, Urgency,,,,,,
"Commented if a lender called to say they were trying to settle on a property by the end of the week, then valuers would do their best to accommodate the completion of the valuation on time.",Valuation Orders, Urgency,,,,,,
"Commented that sometimes a property has sold up to 2 or 3 months ago and the valuation request has only arrived with the valuation firm as the lender is trying to settle the loan, with an urgency on the valuation.",Valuation Orders, Urgency,,,,,,
"A lot of the banks have got very different standards and approaches to some of the valuation requirements as well. Again, managing that is a challenge. So, it's probably some of that inconsistency which is around.",Banks, Standing Instructions, Challenges,,,,,
"Commented that some valuation reports are automatically escalated by banking systems after the valuer has submitted it. Commented that previously when doing valuation, he would use whatever evidence was available and try to avoid an escalation by adding as much information as possible, only to have the banking system automatically escalate the valuation report anyway.",Banks, Valuation Reports, Escalations,,,,,
"Asked how valuers communicate with lenders or brokers today. Responded, at a minimum progress on valuations goes back the API back through ValEx, some integration with MarketValuer (commented this would happen with WPB next year). Delays will be communicated back through the system and followed up with emails to the lenders or brokers.",Feedback and Communication, Competitor Products, Delays, MarketValuer,,,,
Commented also that some banks put stipulations on certain valuers acting as an authorising signature on the valuation reports (mentioned Citibank as an example). And this can create delays when only certain valuers are unavailable to authorise a report. Mentioned for some banks there are only one or two people in each state who can countersign a report.,Resisting Change, Banks, Valuation Reports, Delays, Review Signoff,,,
Also mentioned LMI inconsistencies can hold up report.,LMI, Insurance Provider, Valuation Reports,,,,,
Commented that Heritage bank also want environmental and flood risk on every property that is assessed.,Banks, Environmental Data, Risk or Impact,,,,,
"Banks also differ in their credit, risk and compliance policy levels. For example, some banks will allow up to 5-unit development to be handled by the residential panel, while others will only allow up to 3-unit developments to be assessed by the residential panel before it gets elevated to the commercial panel.",Banks, Compliance and Regulations, Challenges,,,,,
"Mentioned differences in banks around the contract of sales - some only require valuers to verbally state they are aware that the sale is under contact without sightings of the contract, while others other banks want a fully sighted contract that is signed and countersigned by all parties concerned.",Banks, API Organisation, Contract Of Sale, Lenders, Compliance and Regulations,,,
"It depends on the aspect. Sometimes the industry, potentially is a little bit slow to change. A lot of that is out of the control of the valuation firms themself. Because you've got industry bodies which dictate standards and requirements. You've also got like mortgage insurers as well. Mortgage insurers are, well as any insurance company is very risk averse. So, any changes are often difficult to get through. And as a valuation firm you can't operate unless you've got [liability] insurance.",Change or Disruption, Risk Appetite, Insurance Provider, Resisting Change, Challenges,,,
Commented that insurers and valuation governing body (API in Australia and to a lesser extent RICS) determine what a valuation firm can and can't do. There is also in IVS - the International Valuation Standards.,API Organisation, RICS, Insurance Provider,,,,,
"Additionally, valuation firms also need to comply with the individual banking requirements as well.",Valuers, Banks, Compliance and Regulations,,,,,
Commented that valuation firms need to comply with their liability insurance.,Compliance and Regulations,,,,,,,
Also noted that the 2 main industry providers of LMI insurance (namely QBE and Genworth) are also slow to implement change. Commented that the valuation industry changed LMI parameters a few years ago and raised the threshold for valuers with residential property status to $2m (where previously this was $1m). This means valuers have a threshold up to $2m on a property before the LMI option on a loan is cut off.,LMI, Insurance Provider, Change or Disruption,,,,,
"And while Genworth have updated their caps for residential properties $2m, QBE are still capped at $1.25m, so there is a difference in LMI providers.",LMI, Insurance Provider,,,,,,
Commented on recent push on QBE from the valuation industry to raise their caps to $2m for the residential property valuer.,LMI, Insurance Provider,,,,,,
Noted it was the insurers and valuation governing body are slower than the banks to adopt change.,Insurance Provider, API Organisation, Resisting Change, Banks, Change or Disruption,,,
"Brokers and individual lenders might have some strong thoughts on change, which is required [in the financial sector]... and in our industry.  Again, there's the banks themselves who are often one of the last sort of bodies to accept the change and get it approved through their own credit and risk areas as well.",Banks, Change or Disruption, Risk or Impact, Credit Risk,,,,
Sometimes it's just the inconsistently I guess between the 2 mortgage insurers having one of them capped at 2 million and one of them capped at 1.25. It's just that inconsistency for a valuation business that makes it a bit harder to manage. You can't automate things as much when you've got some information dictating the process in the background. And we don't actually get a data set for that.,LMI, API Organisation, Compliance and Regulations, Challenges,,,,
"Mentioned staff and valuer are kept up to date with several different internal intranets. In addition, the WPB compliance team also frequently reiterate the standards and expectations to all staff, with follow-ups and sharing of key information. Commented that keeping up to date with all standards and compliance is a constant and on-going effort within valuation firms.",Support and Education, Compliance and Regulations, Training, Time and Effort,,,,
"It's just another part of our process that we need to be aware of. It sometimes trips you up because you might get a report ready to go and at the last minute our compliance team has realised 'Hey, you haven't got all the information needed for this bank'. So, we have to put the job on hold and put a delay on it to get that information before we can proceed. Or it gets submitted through the system and you might get a query back on it.",Compliance and Regulations, Delays, Concern or Worry, Banks, Change or Disruption,,,
"Is there a future opportunity for a range of policy and compliance products aimed at both banks and valuers to help them manage their obligations better. This may include intranet solutions; training solutions and message and support solutions to help lenders, brokers and valuers to manage their needs better.",Opportunity, Compliance and Regulations, Banks, Support and Education, Training, FOLLOW-UP,,
"I hope I don't see that world. To work as a valuer and actually physically walk through real estate and for houses, I think it's an important aspect of being a good valuer... to be honest. If you're sitting behind your desk all day and just analysing and looking at photos, I think you would completely lose touch with the market. And I think it is dangerous for an industry to move to an environment where the majority of valuations are non-access valuations.",Concern or Worry, Change or Disruption,,,,,,
Particularly when you're in a market within an area where it might be the top of a value range for a different location or a specific location. You might look at stuff on photos and look at things online it'd be a significant different to the actual feel of the property when you go through it. So I think it's pretty dangerous to move to an environment where it's not accessed. I think there's enough government and banking regulation around to hopefully we never see that environment.,Concern or Worry, Compliance and Regulations, Banks, Change or Disruption,,,,
Commented that valuation firms want to have surety the banks are following their processes and doing their due diligence and would recommend (from the valuation firms) that best practices are followed where physical inspections are needed.,Business Practice, Banks, Compliance and Regulations, Physical Inspection,,,,
Wanted to be sure that valuation firms continue to operate and conduct valuations with an element of independence.,Needs and Wants,,,,,,,
Mentioned valuation fees are also an important aspect to the industry. Commented that desktop or non-access (e.g. kerbside assessments) are provided to lenders and brokers at a reduced fee.,Concern or Worry, Valuation Fees,,,,,,
"What we've seen for the last 10 years in our industry is been a general declining in the average fee for different services. And a lot of that's through automation and better systems, and valuation firms getting bigger, and stuff like that. But you run a real risk when the valuation fees keep reducing. In some ways what we're seeing now where there's a shortage of valuers in the field to do the work. We've lost a lot of good people in the industry to other areas of the industry, or completely lost them altogether.",Concern or Worry, Change or Disruption, Valuation Fees, Risk or Impact,,,,
"There's a sense that, if the fees are less in the industry, the work you do is not that well regarded. You just lose a number of people. And as soon as you start to lose a number of people you need to either make changes to reduce the, not so much the quality but reduce some of those barriers to get into the industry. Make it easier for people to get into; to attract more people. Then you,re getting a reduced quality of individuals or workers in the sector. At the moment to be a valuer you have to do a 3- or 4-year bachelor degree, or do a post-grad degree. And you,ve got to get essentially 2 years of experience before you can be a valuer.",Concern or Worry, Valuation Fees, QA, Challenges,,,,
Commented if the entry level for new people into the industry is lowered then this may impact on the quality and standard of valuation in the future - mentioned it was an important balancing act.,Valuers, Qualifications, QA,,,,,
"Asked if a valuation firm query team could resound to a query from a lender or broker, or does the initial valuer have to respond to any queries. Responded, the operations or admin will first review all valuation queries coming from a lender or broker, when they come through.",Valuation Orders,,,,,,,
"Requests to review additional sales evidence (comparables), increase the valuation, or to review any additional documentation must be conducted by the inspecting valuer. Commented that these types of requests cannot be fast-tracked to another member of staff. At times the operations or admin team may speak to a lender on the phone to help with a query, but the inspecting valuer must review all files and respond to queries.",Property Sales, Valuation Queries, Delays, Challenges,,,,
"We can't amend the valuers' file, or valuation unless they do or provide us confirmation in writing. Which can be a challenge because we've got valuers on annual leave, or they're sick or they've resigned and no longer work for the company. It is a challenge too if we get amendments on those valuation or queries.",Valuation Queries, Business Practice, Challenges,,,,,
"Commented that sometimes queries on very old, or out-of-date valuation come through form lenders. In this case the admin team would inform the lender or broker that the valuation can't be amended or queried due to the time that has passed since the valuation was first submitted.",Valuation Queries, Business Practice, Challenges,,,,,
"Asked about any missing data sets a lender or broker could provide to valuers. Responded the accuracy of the information provided by the lenders and brokers is important - for example, access details, supporting required documents for a construction build assessment (i.e. proper site and property plan documents), or purchase valuation (i.e. missing a contract of sale).",Data Gaps, Data Sets, Construction Build, Areas to improve,,,,
"Need lenders to clearly indicate market value or estimated market value of a property, as well as the loan purpose (e.g. a purchase or a refinance scenario) and also wanting to know how accurate the lender/broker provided estimate is. These missing pieces of information all lead to delays.",Borrowers Estimate, Loan Application, Support and Education, Delays,,,,
Commented that lenders and brokers have mostly been unrestricted in how they order valuation and banks could do a better job on their side in managing this.,Valuation Orders, Banks, Support and Education, Areas to improve,,,,
"Asked what role LIXI plays in the industry. Responded that most valuers would not know what this standard was, but knew it is the standard used to send API data packets between banks and valuation firms, as well as property data aggregators. Commented the LIXI standard could help valuation firms to design systems in a certain way to ensure all clients could ingest the data standards.",Banks, Data Sets,,,,,,
"Under the API for mortgage purposes we've got the PropertyPro supporting memorandums. And we're got desktop instructions. There's also long-form instructions as well. You've got the standing instructions [from banks], the mortgage valuations. All of our valuations would comply with that. If we're doing things, sort of private work or consultancy work for say a family law valuation for court purposes, we'll also have to comply with the instructions and the court legislation that might be applicable for that valuation. Particularly if it's for expert witness. And then we've also got the international valuation standards that we need to comply with, always.",API Organisation, Property Report, Banks, LGA, Compliance and Regulations,,,
Commented that no valuation work is conducted outside of a standard - there should always be a minimum standard for the valuation firm to comply with.,Business Practice, Compliance and Regulations,,,,,,
Commented that REIV (used in Melbourne) and CoreLogic products are still a little ahead of MarketValuer in terms of property data. Wants to see MarketValuer have the latest information available in our platform.,Competitor Products, Data Gaps, MarketValuer,,,,,
"For us, it would be all of the recent sales. Having the address, and sale price and sale dates. Having that information. And then from a valuer's perspective if it's as much information in the one place is preferred. If they've got all the photos available, even the description, the floor plan which might have been advertised [by real estate agents]. If that's all there in the MarketValuer platform for them to look at it means they don't need to go elsewhere to find it.",Needs and Wants, Property Sales, Data Sets, Photos, Agents, MarketValuer,,

Commented on the feedback from valuers is the MarketValuer data is improving.,Feedback Positive, MarketValuer,,,,,,
Would like to be included in further rounds of testing.,FOLLOW-UP,,,,,,,
Commented it was a lack of awareness by brokers or lenders on the ordering side when requesting desktop valuations over $1.5m.,Understanding Unclear,,,,,,,
Commented that some lenders consider requesting desktops when doing compliance orders. And some lenders give or reduce allocations based on the compliance needs required. Noted there should be a stop or hold in systems (either in our platform or the banks) to flag when desktop requests are nearing the $1.5m threshold. Commented that valuers should also be aware of these thresholds and know the rules.,Lenders, Compliance and Regulations, Allocations, Banks, MarketValuer,,,
I can only imagine it's a lack of awareness with people ordering in the valuers sometimes. But in a perfect world there's a stop in your [MarketValuer] system that just doesn't allow that to happen.,Values and Beliefs, Valuation Orders, MarketValuer,,,,,
"There is always the - 'Hey, the estimates 1.3 [million dollars]. It's worth 1.6'. A valuer should escalate that. Sometimes a valuer will put that [higher] figure on it. Again, lack of awareness [and] education around what's acceptable and what's not.",Escalations,,,,,,,
Asked about valuer compliance processes. Responded that Opteon don't have a compliance policy or means to check desktops and they are ordered and actioned through the MarketValuer platform and desktop valuation tool (DeskTop 1.0).,Compliance and Regulations, MarketValuer,,,,,,
Specialised property types also cause issues in desktop orders; 2-in-1 lines (where an address or multiple attributes can appear on one line; off-the-plan units; and certain property types that are not acceptable in the valuation request.,Unique Property, Address Matching,,,,,,
Lack of information in MarketValuer tools can cause issues in completing a valuation. Commented this may be hard for lenders to stop when ordering but can lead to automatic escalation when the order reaches the valuer.,Escalations, Data Gaps, DeskTop 1.0, Valuation Orders, Feedback Negative,,,
"Lack of sales in an area, or valuing a unique property with no similar properties in the areas is challenging for valuers.",Unique Property, Property Sales, Needs and Wants, Areas to improve,,,,
In a perfect world you've got a few inferior [comparable sales] clearly; a few comparable; a couple superior.,Property Sales, Needs and Wants, Areas to improve,,,,,
Sometimes you have a unique property that has no sales. Like there is nothing exactly like it. And then you have to start researching more than normal. Thinking out the box with your analysis. Speaking to a lot of people in the industry like agents and everything.,Unique Property, Property Sales, Property Research, Agents,,,,
Commented that unique properties happens a lot in regional area and 'hence that's why desktops aren't as widespread in remote locations'.,Unique Property, Regional or Remote,,,,,,
Unique properties can also be found around new estates and developments in cities where there's an old federation-style mansion and these can be a challenge to value when they are unique.,Unique Property, Challenges, New Developments,,,,,
Commented that other things that would add value in our products for valuers inspecting a unique property is Planning layers. Mentioned that every state provides planning and development information in a number of different ways (noting the NSW planning portal is a good resource for valuers). Queensland state government however does not provide a centralised planning portal so valuers must search for planning and development information at a council level.,Opportunity, Value Add, Zoning Data, Development Planning, Unique Property,,,
"We look at the zoning, the LGA [local government areas]. If there's a DA [development application] on it, on property. If it's heritage zoning; flooding; bushfire. Any other environmental overlays. Then you're looking at then inherent risks around it. Which could be transmission lines; traffic; everything like that. These are all really layers that can be added. We are going places to find that [information] as well as inspecting the property and being able to see it with our eyes. But in reality, you can get it all but there just work in aggregating all the data.",Zoning Data, LGA, Development Planning, Environmental Data, Surrounding Area, Value Add,,
On physical inspections valuers would speak to local estate agents. This takes more research time to assess the property and can have a higher fee (and this fee can be negotiated with the lender).,Physical Inspection, Agents, Property Research, Time and Effort, Challenges,,,
Commented that issues can show up as a lack of attributes and supporting information. Also mentioned for commenting on environmental factors there are no corresponding risk rating in desktops at present.,Attributes, Data Gaps, Environmental Data, Risk or Impact,,,,
"If you were to know it's [subject property] in a one-in-five year flooding area, or one-in-fifty year flooding area or it's in a heritage area, or things that you need to do a bit more research on. Or its next door to transmission lines. Attributes where it's going to affect - detrimentally - what the property's worth. There would be escalation because of that because more research would be needed what the affectations does to the property and what it does to the sales as well.",Environmental Data, Risk or Impact, Surrounding Area, Challenges,,,,
For times when there are no recent comparables sales then a valuer must do a lot more local research to produce a signed report.,Property Sales, Property Research, Time and Effort, Valuation Reports,,,,

Mentioned that ESG (Environmental, Social and corporate Governance) and sustainability conversation are coming to the fore.",Environmental Data, Sustainability Data, Risk Appetite, Risk or Impact,,,,
Commented that lenders will be looking at more trends and info relating to sustainability and environmental impacts at an individual property level.,Sustainability Data, Environmental Data, Needs and Wants, Lenders, Opportunity,,,
"Ongoing and future challenges with the valuation and property trend models, noting that 'They're still not great'.",Challenges, Valuation Models,,,,,,
"Regulation is always a challenged. Commented that if there are regulation changes and valuations are not needed, then valuers could be out of work.",Challenges, Compliance and Regulations, Concern or Worry,,,,,

Valuers conducting physical inspections use tablets with Opteon's system (Halo) that can be used offline or online. Within the Halo system valuers can add sketches or take measurements of a property. Valuers will usually input the data as they go from room to room within a property.,Digital Tools, Physical Inspection, Valuers,,,,,
All photos added within Halo are time and date stamped as well as geo-location tagged.,Photos, Business Practice,,,,,,
"You've got different preferences of the same tools. People have preferences on tablet and the hardware used. I mean some valuers still use trundle-wheel right, so it's pen and paper. It's pretty standardised now. As tech gets better everyone wants the most efficient way possible to do the job.",Preference, Habits and Routines, Valuers,,,,,
"Asked about using future tools (and opportunity) that blended Opteon data with MarketValuer data (for example, more comparable sales).",Opportunity, MarketValuer, FOLLOW-UP,,,,,
"The more info you have in front of the valuer presented to them in an easy efficient manner, the less escalations you'll have. It could be an argument that the valuer should know that sale anyway and search for it, or whatever or look in our system. But being honest and you want the most efficiencies, and less escalations and less escalations. [Then] the more data you can put in your platform, and including our data and integrate it, [it] would help, I think, for sure.",Needs and Wants, Data Sets, MarketValuer,,,,,
"[For full valuation] I see merit in it. I see, you know there'll be people chasing all the time 'Where's my valuation?' It could get a bit, 'So, what credit and risk do well, what lenders do well, is protect the valuers in a lot of instances from people who are unreasonable'. It would put them more directly in touch with a valuer, which, it happens now don,t get me wrong. Our valuers book jobs and their numbers everywhere and they do get a lot of calls from brokers and everything like that. The only risk there would be the really rude people and the unreasonable people. And the back and forth you might get which is not productive for anyone.*",Physical Inspection, Credit Risk, Communication Tools, Value Add,,,,
Commented too on protecting the valuers from any harassment.,Communication Tools, Needs and Wants,,,,,,
For any lender/broker to valuer messaging UI solutions in future products we need to consider ethical design approach.,Communication Tools, FOLLOW-UP,,,,,,
Commented that desktop orders in the future should occur much quicker and would not require lender/valuer messaging.,Desktop Valuations, Valuation Orders, Values and Beliefs,,,,,
"If any order was generated directly in the Opteon system (called Halo), then each order goes through around 400 automated QA ordering and compliance checks - some specific and some general checks. Today Opteon actively manage the upkeep of their QA and rules engine. Updates means new checks are introduced and old out-dated check are taken out.",Business Practice, QA, Compliance and Regulations, Valuation Orders,,,,
A Compliance team and a Quality Management team manage the rules and updates.,Compliance and Regulations, QA,,,,,,
"With the desktop's obviously we're relying on the QA you have in your platform. But when you go to the lenders' some lenders have their own QA team and they're doing retrospective audits. So, Westpac for instance are doing retrospective audits on desktops. And they'll say '8 times out of a hundred job you've submitted a report over 1.5 mill'. And they do it as a percentage. You're above the rest of the competitors; you're going to lose allocation because of that on a quarterly basis. So that's what I meant by a compliance on the other side. Again, we have valuers, [who] should be doing their own QA, obviously as they're doing a report. But we are reliant - a little bit -on your product to have your own QA in there as well.",QA, Lenders, Audits, Desktop Valuations, Allocations, Location or Postcode, Valuation Reports, MarketValuer

"Orders are received in a number of ways - direct to valuer; through valuation aggregator platforms (i.e. CoreLogic, Velocity, ValEx) or through MarketValuer API. LIXI packets are sent through the aggregator platforms. And orders are managed in Opteon through their internal system, that also performs a number of checks on the orders. Valuation jobs are then routed to specific valuers to book their own job (using the booking team).",Valuation Orders, Competitor Products, MarketValuer,,,,,
Mentioned Opteon are piloting a Schedulo (booking tool) integration to allow job to go direct to customers to book property inspections.,Digital Tools, Booking Appointments, Valuers,,,,,
"Valuers would communicate impacts any extra research time required on unique properties, risk factors or any environmental impacts to lenders and provide reasons. The valuers may also pass communications of delays and impacts to the broker or lender credit team to keep them in the loop.",Valuers, Risk or Impact, Delays, Communication Tools,,,,
"Totally understand it. Half of what we try to do is to work out how we can help the turnaround times. There's a fine line. Desktop's are great for turnaround time. But there's a lot of escalations; there's a lot of rework. If a desktop gets escalated, it usually ends up taking longer than if they order a [full] valuation.",Service Levels SLA, Valuation Orders, Escalations, Rework, Frustration,,,
"Even if a desktop is ordered and comes in lower than what they think and gets reordered, it ends up costing more than if they got a full inspection at the start. Or, if it gets escalated to a full [valuation] straight away, it still takes longer than if it just got this [ordered as a full valuation]. There's pros and cons to everything.",Desktop Valuations, Escalations, Challenges, Valuation Orders,,,,
Commented on 2 types of queries they receive from lenders and brokers - non-avoidable and avoidable queries. An example given for a non-avoidable query is where there has been a change to the plans in a construction build.,Valuation Orders, Construction Build,,,,,,
It's no-one's fault. They've [the customer] done that and we have to do the job. It is what it is.,Challenges, Valuation Queries,,,,,,
"There's avoidable queries where you know, we've overlooked something or made a mistake. And the lender can't lend on it [the valuation] or the [bank] credit teams picked it up and it's come back to us. We have to rework it. It's rework for us; it's rework for everyone.  it's rework for the lender. And that, just straight away you're losing money. So, there's a lot of internal focus on stopping rework. Which is valid for desktops, fulls [valuation], everything.",Valuation Queries, Rework, Time and Effort, Banks, Frustration, Areas to improve,,
Commented that banks also need to improve their own internal processes. Gave an example where a lender takes 20 days to do their internal loan assessments and requests orders near the end of this process. Commented that a 3-day valuation wasn't the issue where lenders are taking weeks and months to complete their own loan assessments.,Areas to improve, Banks, Rework, Valuation Queries, Time and Effort, Frustration,,
Commented on the on-going challenge of meeting quality and a fast turnaround time.,QA, Service Levels SLA, Challenges,,,,,
There's always going to be that fine line between quality versus speed. Doing the job we need to do and mitigating risk. But doing it at speed where we're not the lenders aren't losing customers because of it.,Challenges, QA, Service Levels SLA,,,,,
Asked about changes on the lenders side to make valuation orders more efficient. Commented that lenders are usually checking (or their system is checking) certain postcode and regions that have property flags. Also noted that more education provided to lenders and brokers when generating valuation orders would be helpful.,Valuation Orders, Support and Education, Location or Postcode, Prep Work,,,,
"There needs to be more work done at the front-end as people are ordering. Just to educate them [lenders]. Even if it's a checklist or something. 'Hey, does it fit this profile'. And they do that for probably LVR or what the situation is for them [the bank]. But do they go all the way to the property type [in their checks].

Commented that the valuation industry is ripe for change and technology will be a big disruptor.,Change or Disruption,,,,,,,
Valuers are worried about being displaced by technology and are worried about staying relevant in the coming years.,Concern or Worry, Change or Disruption,,,,,,
"We've been talking about being automated out of a job for 10 years you know, and it hasn't happened yet. Sure, there's going to be change. Sure, someone like MarketValuer is going to come in and there might be more desktops in the future. But, hey that doesn't mean it the end of the world. We've just got to adapt to that change.",Change or Disruption, Concern or Worry, Embracing Change, MarketValuer,,,,

"Participant recognised that disruption and change is coming, and valuation firms need to be adaptable to embrace this change to stay relevant and in business.",Change or Disruption, Embracing Change,,,,,,
I think there are ways to make desktops - even Fulls [valuations] - not much slower. There's always going to be slower. But not much slower than an AVM. But a whole heap more accurate. And if we can halt the progress of AVM's or use them to our advantage with the added local valuer knowledge... there's always room for valuers.,Desktop Valuations, AVM, Opportunity,,,,,
There could be a future opportunity to explore of enriching Valuer data with MarketValuer data to provide the tools need to get a more accurate valuation.,Opportunity, Digital Tools, MarketValuer, FOLLOW-UP,,,,
"Asked about quantity surveyor reports and mortgage imposition reports. Responded that MIP (Mortgage Imposition) has it own report type (which is similar to a long-form valuation report) with set criteria for mortgagees.

"Commented that Opteon does tax depreciation reports, but the valuer do not handle QS (Quantity Survey) reports. Also noted that some banks manage their own QS panels and commented that most QS companies are small and manage their own different templated reports.",Quantity Survey, Tax Depreciation, Banks, Property Report,,,,
Commented that Opteon have 2 dedicated people in the company who will do QS reports when asked by banks and these reports are different to valuer reports.,Quantity Survey, Banks, Valuation Reports,,,,,
"Any valuation over 5 million cannot be done on a PropertyPro [report]. It's done on a, like a long-form report. Again, each valuations firms' long-form may be slightly different. There are standing instructions. They are similar but there could be little tweaks here and there because we're not as rigid as the PropertyPro is. PropertyPro is a template where long-form is 'Meet the standing instructions of the bank'. And all the banks have different ones. But you can set out the [long-form] template how you really want. They're a 30-page report.",PropertyPro, Property Report, API Organisation, Banks, Valuation Reports,,,
Tax Depreciation reports' valuers inspect them right now. And graduate inspectors. Our employed QS [quantity surveying] does the calculations and sends them off. It's a bit of a shared service.

"I suspect it's a number of contributing factors. I would suggest the primary [reason] would be under-representing the estimate of market value by the customer. And then the valuers take one look at it and see clearly, it's going to be worth more than 1.5. And it's escalated.",Valuation Orders, Desktop Valuations, Escalations,,,,,
Commented they were not sure why these desktop orders over $1.5m are occurring.,Valuation Orders, Desktop Valuations,,,,,,
Commented that feedback from lenders has been there is an appetite and review 'and look holistically at' the existing $1.5m threshold values for desktop valuations.,Desktop Valuations, Valuers, Challenges,,,,,
Having a fixed limit valued cap for a service type doesn't really - in my view - address particular market nuances. And what I've submitted to the API is a view to suggest that they should have a much more dynamic way of assessing the types of properties that are eligible for desktops. As opposed to having a fixed value limit.,API Organisation, Desktop Valuations, Valuers, Challenges,,,,
Valuers have to work within the current limits of the desktop memorandum for thresholds.,Valuers, Desktop Valuations, Standing Instructions,,,,,
Commented that the current desktop value limits are not flexible enough to support these types of valuation of current Melbourne and Sydney properties.,Desktop Valuations, Pain Point, Challenges,,,,,
"More often than not their [property owners] opinion of value is higher than what the value actually is, or supported. Right now, we're in a bit of a unique environment in most markets around the country. Where the market is accelerating at such rapid rates that we're seeing more prevalent instructions come through [from the bank]. Whether they're desktops or other types of instruction coming through, where the customer estimate is actually more conservative, and the property is worth more than the customer estimate. I wouldn't describe that as being the usual dynamic. And, in fact, usually it's the opposite.",Owner-Occupant, Property Value, Banks, Borrowers Estimate, Challenges,,,

Anything we can do to increase the accuracy of that customer estimate would seem to be a logical place to start.",Desktop Valuations, Standing Instructions, Compliance and Regulations, Valuation Orders,,,,
Commented on questionable or bad behaviours amongst some brokers who are inputting inaccurate information in order to 'beat the system and get an outcome that tries to manipulate the business rules'.,Habits and Routines, Behaviour, Brokers,,,,,
"One of the inherent reputational issues that desktops have across all the providers is a received level of conservatism. And I say perceived as I think it can be disproven. But I think at a legacy level, and a historic level desktops probably haven't had the attention and focus from either the provider - you know, you or CL [CoreLogic] - and us as the valuers. And that's generated, unfortunately, an environment where particularly brokers, but lenders in general are averse to ordering them and relying on them. Their preference [lenders and brokers] is to get a short-form, given that the banks pay for them anyway for a residential mortgage.",Desktop Valuations, Values and Beliefs, Banks, Lenders, Valuation Orders, Challenges, Preference,

Thinks brokers are trying to manipulate the outcome based on the type of valuations they will order (i.e. get a higher valuation).,Values and Beliefs, Behaviour, Brokers, Lenders, Valuation Orders,,,
Commented that documentation issues and delays related to construction build has been discovered to be a major delay cause of delays based on internal HTW analysis. This includes getting all the building contracts and amendments to contract which can have special conditions upfront and not having to go back and continuously request documents.,Delays, Construction Build, Challenges, Valuation Orders, Documentation, Info Requests,,
"On resi mortgage work valuers are dealing within a fairly tight structure and protocol of what they can and can't do. The [banks] standing instruction are now so well defined there's very little room for interpretation in terms of how you arrive at the valuation assessment itself. We still get from time to time where valuers come up with differences of opinion. But at the end of the day part and parcel of the human element, I suppose of requesting an opinion on value.",Banks, Standing Instructions, Valuation Reports, Compliance and Regulations, Values and Beliefs,,,
Commented that valuers don't actively think about taking a conservative approach to protecting themselves. They are conscious of the standing order constraints to work within and a defendable evidence-based valuation.,Compliance and Regulations, Standing Instructions, Evidence, Valuers, Valuation Reports,,,
Commented on delays occurring where the sales evidence used in a report is not in line with what valuers are seeing in their areas or are aware of within their areas. These issues occur when know sales data are not appearing within desktop valuations. This is where discrepancies in the desktop report can occur.,Delays, Desktop Valuations, Property Sales, Data Gaps, Challenges,,,
"Where a property has not transacted in a number of years, or it has no leasing (rental) information reduces the confidence of the valuer to make an accurate desktop valuation. This is a cause of escalation to a physical valuation.",Data Gaps, Desktop Valuations, Escalations,,,,,
To decrease escalations valuers want an optimal view of all recent and accurate sales data (as possible) within the desktop. Legacy data and lack of sales evidence are the 2 more common reasons for desktop escalations.,Areas to improve, Escalations, Desktop Valuations, Property Sales,,,,
"We ingest sales feeds into our core platform and present that through to them [the valuers].

"We try to minimise that as much as possible. And we do that by integrating with the feeds so that it's pre-populated. Our goal is to keep them in our environment, almost exclusively. Every time they have to log out and log back into another environment or open another tab and become familiar with another platform is time lost.",Business Practice, Needs and Wants, Data Sets, Valuers,,,,
If you look at what I said about our ecosystem and our valuers using our platform. And if you then look at some of the problems statements that we're trying to solve collectively around confidence in desktops; we're trying to encourage the valuers to spend more time in the desktops; we're trying to elevate that through the standards and the desktop policies. Elevate it's [the desktop] use case. Whether that's to elevate the value limits [desktop thresholds] or increase the scope. All of those things require the valuers to take the desktops more seriously and be more interactive with them.,Needs and Wants, Desktop Valuations, Opportunity, FOLLOW-UP,,,,
"Commented that if there was some way to more closely integrate the desktop product with the HTW platform and valuer's workflow, then this could help avoid going in and out of HTW's core system.",Opportunity, Property Value, Desktop Valuations, Data Sets, FOLLOW-UP,,,
"HTW have a source of truth for the sale properties as they conduct around 600k physical valuations a year (mostly for refinance loans and a smaller number for actual sales). At some point in time HTW valuers will physically go through a property connected to a loan. With the amount of data built for each property through inspections, listings, sales etc. it becomes a trusted source of truth that valuers can rely on as sales evidence in the future.",Business Practice, Data, Valuers, Opportunity,,,,

"We're not interested in lining CoreLogic's pockets any more than we need to. If you guys had a data offering today, I'd buy it. So, if there's a conversation here that we can have that says 'what sales evidence could we ingest into our platform' and how could we create a MarketValuer Herron Todd White desktop that is integrated into our platform, or more integrated so our valuers have got the confidence particularly around that sales evidence component.

Commenting on struggle to find a PI (professional indemnity) insurer who will insure this type of enriched desktop valuation.,Challenges, Insurance Provider, Liability or Indemnity,,,,,
Mentioned opportunity to follow-up with HTW in 2022 to discuss a partnership with HTW to explore areas of enriched sources of information.,Opportunity, Data Sets, MarketValuer, FOLLOW-UP,,,,

"Commented that a while some time ago where they used to see some orders being sent by brokers for valuations to get around fees. For example, brokers may send an order with slightly lower estimate to avoid higher (LMI) fees being attached to the loan.",Brokers, Valuation Orders, Fees, LMI,,,,
Existing feedback is most people (especially brokers) would avoid getting a desktop valuation in favour of a short-form as their view is it will provide them a higher valuation standard to be able to get a loan application approved.,Values and Beliefs, Brokers, Preference,,,,,
"I think some brokers have seen the short-form as the passport for want of a better term. They can take around [to banks for loan applications], and maybe desktop doesn't have that. Especially when some lenders a having far different strategies in use of desktops and AVM's.",Values and Beliefs, Brokers, Valuation Orders, Banks, Preference,,,
"Current trend is owner property estimates are now starting to come in below the actual market value. This could be driving valuation decisions to order a desktop, but with the higher market values, desktops orders are then deemed unsuitable for a higher valued property.",Values and Beliefs, Owner-Occupant, Borrowers Estimate, Valuation Orders, Property Value,,,
Commented with the pace of market change there may be less desktop and more reliance on usable AVM's - the speed in the market is almost unprecedented.,Challenges, Desktop Valuations, AVM, Time and Effort,,,,
"With the fast pace of property sales in the market, and property data (and record property prices) unable to keep pace, sometimes valuers are speaking to real estate agents in depth about activities at auctions to understand the number and amount of bidding that is occurring.",Challenges, Property Sales, Agents,,,,,
Have heard anecdotally that if lenders are not in a rush to complete a valuation (e.g. in refinance scenarios) then they will opt for a short-form over a desktop.,Values and Beliefs, Desktop Valuations, Kerbside Valuations, Lenders, Refinance Loans, Expectations,,
"Challenges with desktops occurs in areas of new developments or new property build, where comparable sales or data is not widely available.",Challenges, Desktop Valuations, Property Sales, Data Gaps, Lenders, Expectations,,
"If you look at the desktop benefit - cost and time. And a high level of accuracy in the right situations. If time's not a factor because they're [brokers] doing a refinance that's only just kicking off. Or they haven't even started working out which bank they're going to go to, and they're just going to start the valuation process. Then times not a factor. Then cost is not a factor if they're [brokers] getting it for free [as banks pay for the valuations]. So, then you look at the accuracy side. Having the valuer come in and check out all the most recent conditions and the sales. But also, if the figure is lower than expectations, they've also got something to point to manage that customer.",Values and Beliefs, Desktop Valuations, Behaviour, Banks, Lenders, Brokers, Expectations,
One of the more common themes that occurs is around incorrect addresses.,Values and Beliefs, Address Matching,,,,,,
"There are changes that occur in address files for all brokers and lenders (for example, where vanity addresses occur).",Challenges, Address Matching, Brokers, Lenders, Valuation Orders,,,
"Developers will also use a different address on a new development to make it sound more attractive, or in a better location to buyers over what the real actual address is.",Challenges, Developers, Address Matching, Valuation Orders,,,,
"Another major challenge is around varying sources of truth. For example, lenders may be referencing an address off multiple address files and may not have a single view of a correct address.",Challenges, Address Matching, Data, Valuation Orders,,,,
"Even just starting the address matching process can create some challenges. Contact details is also one. I know these are probably common things that you're already hearing. But these are ones that again have not been fundamentally solved. Like, phone number details; the right contact details.",Challenges, Valuation Orders, Address Matching, Info Requests,,,,
"Even people being aware that a valuation is required. I just dealt with a complaint last week. In part it started because the inspection contact [property owner] was already on the back foot going, Why are you coming to my house. You know, it's the same with tenants and things like that.",Valuation Orders, Physical Inspection, Booking Appointments, Owner-Occupant, Challenges,,,
And then documents. Documentation still is challenging to get through to the full amount. Getting all the right information. Not getting inappropriate information like private or sensitive documents but just getting the right information the first time. And every time that happens?,Documentation, Info Requests, Valuation Orders, Prep Work, Challenges,,,
Commented that valuers are trying to resolve issues with documentation (or lack of) in orders within an hour of first being received. Documentation is a common cause for delays.,Valuation Orders, Prep Work, Documentation, Info Requests, Delays, Challenges,,
Missing or outdated documents normally get requested by the operations team in HTW.,Business Practice, Valuation Orders, Prep Work, Documentation, Info Requests,,,
Commented operation team in HTW don't always have a fluid (easy and frictionless) to request missing documents form brokers or lenders. Sometimes the requested documents come from the broker and other times they are requested directly from the customer.,Pain Point, Valuation Orders, Prep Work, Valuers, Data Gaps, Documentation, Info Requests, Areas to improve
"In some cases, requests for missing documents are raised through a platform and then the request get passed through different internal workflows within the bank, and then flows all the way bank to the valuer.",Business Practice, Documentation, Info Requests, Banks, Areas to improve,,,
"The clock really never stops in the residential space. That's how traditionally clients see it. Probably 7 or 8 years ago the clock stopped [pauses on SLA metric when delays occurred]. But it was too open to manipulation. The valuation industry probably applied a lot of delays incorrectly to try and sort of hold up jobs and improve performance. So, moving to a clock never stops, really forced the valuers to change their mindset on that, and try to find ways to resolve some of those issues.",Delays, Service Levels SLA, Challenges, Address Matching, Frustration,,,
"Yeah, so it [the order] goes through a couple of layers. You have that first sniff test, as part of our operations, when we're sort of accepting the job. And then we have assistant valuers. They're sort of grads or people with a bit more skills to identify them [the order and items to check off].",Habits and Routines, Valuation Orders, Prep Work,,,,,
"If you take a problem around split contracts. It's a unusual way in which [property] developers' structure joint house developments. So, it's town house where they're trying to essentially the land and the building components to improve their cashflow. But those are really technical documents, and we get into heaps of trouble and open to liability if we get that wrong. And so sometimes it does take us to actually get out to the development, to the valuer reading it [contracts]. And also, it could be several days before we actually know that there's an issue.",Split Contracts, Developers, Construction Build, Challenges, Valuation Orders,,,
Commented most times the operations team are very good at noticing when documents are missing documents on valuation orders.,Habits and Routines, Valuation Orders, Prep Work, Documentation,,,,
"Commented there could be an opportunity for MarketValuer where developers (or reals estate agents) have provided some of the documentation valuers would need in another part of the business and we could provide those documents to the valuers. Gave examples of developer plans or detailed information that could be utilised by valuers.

",Opportunity, MarketValuer, Agents, Data Gaps, Developers,,,
"Every time we have to stop [with delays] it probably adds, I would say at least 1 to 2 days to the job. And when you're talking about a 2 and a half to 3 day product that's significant.",Delays, Time and Effort, Service Levels SLA,,,,,
"Regarding valuer liability, commenting that valuers and valuation firms essentially need to be able to defend anything they do in a court of law. For example, valuation's done for family law courts. If questioned, a valuer needs to be able to transparently go through the whole of their process and defend the evidence used in the valuation (including the comparable sales data) and demonstrate to a court that the utmost due diligence has been done in gathering evidence and reaching the valuation outcome.",Liability or Indemnity, Valuers, Valuation Reports, Evidence, Property Sales,,,
There is a view that valuers are conservative but knowing that valuation need to be defendable (with supporting evidence) is more of a key driver. Valuation can only be based on the sales evidence available.,Values and Beliefs,,,,,,,
"Commented that DeskTop 1.0 only provides the data we have. Noted that real estate agents will try to maximise the number of rooms within a property in order to increase the sales leads. Gave an example where an agent would list a 4 bedroom and 3 bathroom property that turns out to be 3 bedroom and maybe a small study room along with only 2 bathrooms and an outhouse. This type of propping up by agents in listings also extends into car spaces and other property factors. When valuers analyse the property data and attributes, they may reassess the property and it's value differently to the listed information.",Values and Beliefs, DeskTop 1.0, Desktop Valuations, Agents, Attributes, Data Gaps,,
HTW have property data (based on all their previous physical valuation) within their own internal system and some of the property and sales evidence they have is missing when they use DeskTop 1.0.,Desktop Valuations, DeskTop 1.0, Data Gaps, Areas to improve,,,,
"Photos and data can be challenges when assessing for new developments. Valuers may have information on the vacant land. As land is bought and owners enter into a building contract then valuers will not see new listed data (as property is not going up for sale again) and this means that new build have no new photos or attribute to value on. In addition, even Google street view can provide incorrect photos or old photos of only the land.",Desktop Valuations, Challenges, Photos, Data Gaps,,,,
Valuers use tablets running proprietary HTW applications and data as well as physical laser tools for measuring properties.,Habits and Routines, Valuers,,,,,,

Commented valuation firms are looking for a single application or source of truth that valuers have to deal with.,Needs and Wants, Valuers,,,,,,
"Valuation firms are actively looking at where they can source and bring in more data sources to their core systems that will support valuers in their work. To date HTW have been a little restricted in thinking of what data sources could be ingested into their system, but now thinks there are unique data sets worth looking at that will enhance their business.",Valuers, Opportunity, Data Sets, FOLLOW-UP,,,,
Commented that valuations in Australia are ahead of digital adoption and practices in other countries like New Zealand or USA.,Valuers, Values and Beliefs,,,,,,
Commented on the inertia in the valuation industry is mostly based on residential valuation purposes and noted that this is a slow-moving process with lenders and brokers. So valuers are not always to blame for a lack of appetite or willingness for change.,Values and Beliefs, Challenges, Valuers,,,,,
Risk within the valuations and lending (credit risk) workflows plays a big part of banks inability to change or adopt new workflows.,Risk or Impact, Credit Risk, Banks, Challenges,,,,
"The valuation industry has been a cottage industry a number of years ago. But I would say that in my time at CoreLogic I saw huge advancements in the way that the valuation firms moved to be far more professional organisations. Far more operational as well. Treated parts of their process in a far more operational way. But, maybe because we're dealing in risk and we're dealing with risk management and things like that. Maybe there still is in the back of the mind a little bit of resistance to some changes.",Challenges, Risk or Impact, Blocker, Credit Risk, Banks, Resisting Change,,

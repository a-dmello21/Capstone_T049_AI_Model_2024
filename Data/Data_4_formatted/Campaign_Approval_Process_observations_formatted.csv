"For us, the main issue that we have is everything has to be approved. So, because of the way we are set up we have to go in [to AdManager] and approve everything. Now that means that whenever our brands [suppliers] change - predominantly kind of CPC's or CPI's - there can be up to a 24-hour delay in that piece of activity going back live because we approve things once a day at 3 O'clock.",Business challenge, Approvals, Date or Time related, CPC (Cost Per Click), CPI (Cost Per Impression), Brands, Errors or Issues, AdManager,,
Delays in approving campaign updates on behalf of brands/suppliers is creating tension between Nectar360 and customers. Brands don’t understand why if they are spending more with Nectar360 there cannot be an automatic approval process.,Delays, Campaigns, Approvals, Nectar360, Retailer needs, Automation, Reduce effort,,,
"Commenting on previous discussions with AdManager where if a brand removed a product SKU form a campaign, then the campaign update should be auto-approved if it had been previously approved (as Nectar360 do not need to reapprove a campaign in this scenario).",AdManager, Campaigns, SKU, Approvals, Auto approvals,,,,,
Would only need to re-approve campaign if new SKU’s were being introduced into a previously approved Ad campaign in order to double-check all details were correct.,Campaigns, SKU, Retailer needs, Auto approvals, Reduce effort, Approvals,,,,
"From a search term perspective, a removal of terms should not require an additional approval of a previously approved Ad. However, adding new search terms to a previously approved Ad would require retailer approval.",Search terms / Keywords, Approvals, Reduce effort, Brands,,,,,,
"The general principles that we would want is that any changes from a cash perspective just flow through. We don’t approve. Any removals just flow through, we don’t approve. And any additional would then go back into the approval queue.",Approvals, Future opportunity, Auto approvals, Search terms / Keywords,,,,,,
Clarified that the 'Everything approved' setup was initially configured due to some campaign items are checked by Nectar360 while other campaign items are checked by Sainsburys to ensure all campaign are adhering to the correct retailer standards.,Nectar360, Sainsburys, Operations, Purchase Order (PO), Approvals, On-boarding, AdManager,,,
Initially all brand and supplier wallets were loaded into the system as PO's. But now the PO field is in the AdManager system and assigned (and cannot be edited by brands or suppliers) the dependency to have captured a PO for a wallet has been removed.,Business norm, Brands, On-boarding, Purchase Order (PO), AdManager,,,,,
"New and edited campaigns (previously approved) are not differentiated within the AdManager platform, so all campaigns are considered by the system as new setups, and this is not ideal for Nectar360.",Campaigns, Approvals, Limitation, AdManager, Nectar360,,,,,
"We look at everything as if it's completely brand new. Which is not ideal. Because it's done [campaign approvals] by a human and everything, it's therefore subjective. If things that were approved [previously] then are not approved because it's a different person checking it.",Campaigns, Approvals, Business norm, Routine activity, Limitation, AdManager, Manual effort,,,
"Sainsburys are checking campaigns for cross-sell and banner Ads, and these are the more complex items to check.",Sainsburys, Campaigns, Approvals, Banners, Banners, Cross-sell, Complexity, Manual effort, AdManager,
Nectar360 will check everything else that Sainsbury's team don't check (i.e. no competitors SKU's in a campaign; relevant terms in a search term campaign; search term guidelines are met; default wallets are not being used; the wallet has sufficient budgets; and PO values are also correct to avoid any billing issues).,Nectar360, Routine activity, Sainsburys, Campaigns, SKU, Relevancy, Search terms / Keywords, Wallets, Operations,

Commented AdManager need to do a better job of the visibility of what has changed within the platform as well as a better understanding and support for rules around the approval process.,AdManager, Improve understanding, Retailer needs, UI improvement, Approvals,,,,,
Bids are not shown to the review team so potentially reviewers could be looking at a campaign with bid changes and it would appear as if nothing has changed. Recommended with bid changes a campaign shouldn’t require another review and approval.,Bidding, UI, Nectar360, AdManager, Business challenge, Gap (Product or Service), Limitation, Campaigns,,
When suppliers make a change to an Ad within a campaign and are awaiting approved the entire campaign is no longer live or serving and this has impacts on revenue for retailers. Recommended AdManager keep only the Ad changes in an approval flow while keeping the remaining unchanged parts (Ads) of the campaign live and serving. Approved changes could then go live once re-approved.,AdManager, Brands, Campaigns, Optimisation, Approvals, Impact, Ad serving, Limitation, Loss of revenue, Delays
"Recommended AdManager investigate if it would be possible to flag campaigns in the platform as new or edited. Commented it may not be possible to provide more than a high-level flag, but it may not have additional status details in the flag or indicator.",Follow-up, AdManager, UI, UPC or Indicator, UI improvement, Improve understanding,,,,

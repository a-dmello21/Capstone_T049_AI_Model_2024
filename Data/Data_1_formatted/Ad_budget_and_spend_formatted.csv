"Yeah, it must be hard for you to pivot all your questions because obviously me being admin I did see a Confluence page as well and I was like, oh, here's all the questions coming. So, suppliers are either Always On [spend] which as you're aware, they just spend like wild. It's a very Woolworths approach where they want them to up their credit like crazy. I guess where we have the most trouble is agencies because they get paid to spend a set amount of money as you guys have probably been aware. So, an agency gets $10,000 and their job is to spend it appropriately. And they only get [$]10,000. They don't ask for more. They need the [$]10,000 to go well, and they need it to spread across the time [campaign duration] for reasons I don't really properly grasp but beyond visibility. But that's probably something you either have heard or will hear where they do want to pace it out day by day. But obviously you have the retailers like Woolworths that don't even operate daily spend. Because of the revenue implications from those Always On suppliers having the option to limit their revenue to a per day basis instead of spending like crazy. None of that was the answer to the question you wanted. But dear God, I do love to talk.",Budget, Campaigns, Spend, Brands, Woolworths, Agencies, Revenue, Operations,,,,,,,,,,,

"I don't know, weeks. It's a good question.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"All right. So I guess it comes down to the strategy. You have new product launches, which you want to push hard because you want market share very quick. Those are your heavy spenders because you need to get ahead of Mondelez and the others. You just need people to know that it exists. So those are your aggressive spends and there'd be a couple of weeks to a couple of months depending on how much support you've got from the retailer, and how much visibility, and how your campaigns are performing before you change them back to like a business as usual model. You have kind of like an Always On [spend] approach where you obviously want to continue advertising. But it's less about winning all the time and more about just being around when it shows up [Ad serving]. Those I guess would be all less actively paced in terms of backfill's the wrong word, but it's more like sitting behind in the auction when other people lose out or it's not a strong competition you appear you spend, but it's not a bit about spending a ton. And then you've obviously got your specials, [promotional] pushes and things like that.

"So, we have retailers that do it by brand. Retailers that do it by [campaign] line-item. It's really the US which I'm sure you guys are going to talk to how they get a committed spend of this amount. So, the wallet is this amount. So, you never spend more than that amount across a various amount of campaigns. Then you do get a very rare purchase order approach which is same as line-item actually, but I won't go into it then. In terms of self-managed wallets, Woolworths are a lot more playing around with it now. Where you have like yogurt Always On is one of them, but it still is somewhat of a category-based approach, there's just a variation of it.

That's when all my share bags and lollies go on special like crazy. But that kind of approach. So, I want to spend up until Halloween. I obviously don't want it to spend beyond Halloween, and that's why I put an end date on. I'd like it to spend quite heavily, obviously. I'd like it to not run out of money in the first week because then obviously my competitors get all of the appearance over this high importance time and I've picked this retailer because I like know for a fact, I've got Magnums [ice cream products] in there.

"No, I understand what you mean. So, optimising. Yeah. So, good ones [brands] do because they should be checking how their products are doing within [in-flight], and culling out the lower performing ones to make sure that your high performing ones are better.

"Ok. So, in this case, obviously, I'm still winging it. But if I saw something like this [Daily spend option selected], I would theorise that they have a cap on the wallet. Cap is probably the wrong word, but they have a certain amount of money in the wallet and they're capping it to a daily spend so that they can pace along. If a supplier has like a fixed value [amount] of money they want for, I don't know October or similar in this case, like I want here, my Halloween. Like I've segregated off [allocated] $5000 just for Halloween advertising. Then in that case, it would be $9000 [budget], probably not realistic. Probably like [$]20,000 or something.

"So, I guess one big thing to note if you are interviewing Nectar and Woolworths suppliers is that they don't have the option available. You're probably aware that we don't. Nectar and Woolworths don't show daily spend to suppliers. And the reason for that being that giving people the option to limit how much money they spend per day is obviously revenue limitation. Now, it's interesting because they're [brands] like budget pacing and things like that and I recognise that as well.

No we take away the option.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yeah. And that was one of the things I was going to bring up. Our system in its current implementation is very designed off... I'm unsure whether to say caps or triggers, but basically limits. So, if you're like, I want to spend $1000 in the day as soon as we hit it, that's it. We don't think like, so you want to spend $1000, it's 24 hours. Traffic deviates to about 40% of total, I don't know, 60% of your traffic between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. kind of thing. Like we have none of that smart. It's literally like the campaign has hit budget yes or no kind of thing. Including that Always On or Total spend kind of thing where you're like, I want to spend [$]10,000 for this campaign.

"That's a hell of a Stevie [W] question. Ok, so I'm trying to think smart ones [brands] catch up with Steven every two weeks to month to basically go over how they're performing. You've got really in-depth ones that use like the quick edit in reporting and things like that to up their bid when they see them dropping. Then you've obviously got your set-and-forget ones [brands], which is just Always On 1000 bucks [$1000] for this month, come back next month and see how I did.",Routine activity, Budget, Brands, Optimisation, Spend,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Look? Not too much. I really like the sliders in the fixed spend option. But that's just because I put them in there and it's really cool. But, I've heard Woolies after day-partying before, which is really funny because when we probed them on why there was just one guy that's like, oh, other platforms do it. And well, that's not really a good why. So, we have, as you probably looked at in the fixed spend, we have the maximum hourly spend. And it's a percentage just because that's how it worked back on the tech side. The only reason I'd be careful with that is advertisers wouldn't consider setting a spend of like 30[%] or 40% for a reason of traffic variation. So, if you do introduce that level of cap, try and keep that in mind.",Consideration, Woolworths, Day-parting, Spend, Spend Limits / Cap-outs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It does exist in the fix spend. I'm just loading it up in another window but getting the US portal to load takes some time. I'm not saying it's a good option. I just really like the slider.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"That's a damn good question actually because yes, it was very reactive introduction. So when we launched Mi9 [US retailer software company] at the end of 2019, they went from DSP Google Ad Manager kind of thing where you do pace out all your money. So, we did fixed spend and that was where they've got a committed budget from a brand. And instead of our auction system, it did just in a campaign as a fixed spend. Then we introduced maximum daily spend so that we'd pace them. Very similar idea to this where you know, this is the maximum this account's going to spend per day. Then we have, I'm trying to open up a campaign over here. Yeah, you fixed spend, we'll go to this one [shared a Anheuser-Busch campaign example].",Campaigns, Auctions, Google Ad Manager (GAM), AdManager, Spend Limits / Cap-outs, Pacing, Spend,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Anyway, so I'm just trying to get into that UI stage. We basically have, you know, how much do you want to spend? What are your impressions? Now, this operates on a different system.

But it should show you my really cool slider when it feels like loading.",AdManager, Spend, Impressions, Gap (Product or Service),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"No, it kind of goes through how like the hourly pacing works. It's a spend percentage. It was a bit strange that we went to percentage. I think it was just the easiest for us to calculate. It's going pretty slow at the moment. Yeah, I did see a mock up where like it's like, did you want to spend a maximum per day in like the total spend? And that's kind of an interesting approach. It would probably be easier given it leans on triggers, but obviously, maybe it's not the best.",AdManager, Spend Limits / Cap-outs, Pacing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Tons. But that's also probably because... I can't see now. But there's a fair amount on fixed spend. Like years worth. But a good question would always be why in terms of is it just the way of working? All right, here's fixed spend [shared a US instance of Campaign Strategy setup screen]. So, we have fixed impressions [e.g. 41500], fixed cost per impressions [e.g. $ 0.008]. Really what that's doing is we tested this feature. And I'm sorry, this does go away from your pacing questions. The use case for this feature was I've got a brand committed to spend $332. Really they bought 42,000 impressions from us for a fixed cost, but the committed spend is this. We need a way to spend that in the system. This pretty much just straight-up says this campaign only sends, only spends 0.8 of a cent. And then we have these options to pace them out [max daily spend and select hourly spend slider]. So, if I've got 30 days of spending, I should say my maximum daily spend is, oh, I don't know what, just over 10 bucks or $12. Then if it's only spending that at 4 a.m. we can also pace out the hourly spend to, you know, it's only going to spend a maximum of 35% of the daily spend [using the hourly spend slider]. These are pretty like Ad Op's triggers and, I guess it's your probably first time seeing this. How clear is it to you, how it works?",Managed service, Spend, Pacing, Impressions, Spend Limits / Cap-outs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Well Woolworths won't know that this exists. There's like a 50% chance that Woolworths have never seen this, right?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yes, I definitely wouldn't do the top part [set impressions] because that's around like fixed agreements. And this is a retailer made campaign. The maximum hourly spend threshold. Yeah, it's possible. I'd be interested to hear Woolworth's opinion on further revenue limiting because like you're just letting suppliers spend less per day. Now, you're probably right, like it should pace it out and it does operate on the similar pattern in our system of caps or triggers instead of automatic [setup]. Like I want to spend $50 per day and if you spend $60 one day, spend [$]40 the next kind of thing.",Impressions, Woolworths, Spend Limits / Cap-outs, Spend, AdManager,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yes, correct. It was once [for] Mi9. Katy [A] has been here for a very long time and I assume you're probably speaking to her at some point. Yeah, if not, you should. Ali would be your best at like this is ok for this reason, but it really sucks for A, B and C. She is very good at knowledge of our system, from an actual like Ad Operations perspective. So, she has a lot of good insight on like, yeah, we did this, and it just sucks. So, we don't use it anymore. And you'll be like, what!",Managed service, AdManager,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Like maximum hourly spend was around, to be honest, I think it was only about a sprint maybe two [of development effort] at the time. Do note that this operates in a percentage and that's not that clear, in my opinion that you're talking a percentage of the daily budget. Obviously extending an exact pattern to another spend type it's a lot easier because like, I expect it to work in exactly this way. So that maybe it is an easy win. But I'd stick to if Woolworths would want to slash if all of our like, advertisers would see value in it.",Spend, Performance, Woolworths, Understanding vague, AdManager,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ok. So fixed spend campaigns are another interesting one. That was their first slider after we got rid of sliders, funnily enough. Yeah, so fixed spend banners are... they were built before fixed tenancy. For the record about a year before. And this is pretty much when an Ad generation request comes in, I know I'm going straight all the way over there [set campaign priority to maximum of 10 in the slider]. There's pretty much just a like is there any priority 10 campaigns for this? Yes. No. And then check in there if it's a Yes, they get that like we don't even look for [Ad placement spots] 9, 8, 7, 6. It's just literally like which level on the shelf are you. And I'm trying to grab from the top shelf first.",Spend, Placements, Woolworths, Understanding vague, AdManager,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yeah. Well, the only reason it's retailer used is because it's underneath fixed spend, and fixed spend only, I'd say. It's not so much like, oh, this sucks for supplies. And I know that probably contradicts what I said before. It's just always been a management option underneath fixed spend and we've never extended it out otherwise. I'm sure you've seen a lot of it in our product where it's like, why is this over here and not everywhere else? Because we put it over there.",Spend Limits / Cap-outs, AdManager,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I know it comes from other people's ideas. I know there's a bit of commotion around wallet budgets, but it is fair. So, we have retailers where your wallets are, like if we take Woolworths as your prime example, like maybe you don't want to set up 15 campaigns to spend X amount per day. You just have them all [campaigns] with their set spends and they work off like a wallet cap per day. So, I want to spend 45 grand [$45,000] a month on yogurt. I don't know why you would. But anyway, it really comes down to your suppliers. Like do they want to actively manage this many budgets or do you just want to say the wallet can spend a maximum of this much per day? Again, I didn't answer your question that well, but like I'm interested about wallet caps [limits], right.",Business decision, Wallets, Budget, Spend Limits / Cap-outs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yeah, I guess I have a lot of insight to how they operate in the US. They got one X amount of money and they spend so much time trying to pull all these levers around campaigns trying to make sure you spend the money evenly in an auction system across like the active period. And it sounds exhausting. I guess it's worth finding out how many campaigns get optimised because Woolworths might be very unique where, you know, you've got four yogurt campaigns. But I know across the globe we have just so many granular campaigns where you're really like grouping them into multiple types and it just sounds exhausting to manage them uniquely.",Managed service, USA, Optimisation, Campaigns, Spend Limits / Cap-outs, Manual effort,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It is the reason we put that sneaky little pencil in [pencil/edit icon to the campaign dashboard table to allow brands to edit their max bids inline]. Like a lot of a big on impression share and return on Ad spend [ROAS]. So, I guess as an agency I get employed to get a set return on ad spend for Kraft. That's how I [an agency] get Krafts' money. They don't really want to hear about all these buzzwords. They're just like, look, you can have my $10,000 if you turn it into $30,000, kind of thing. So, return on Ad spends a massive point for brands to keep up. They want impression share. So, I'm sure you guys are aware like impression shares, literally how many impressions did you get out of how many you should have got, or were available? So we're not sure we got them. So as a brand, I obviously want to see my impressions, clicks, conversions and sales, but really it's about ok, so I need my return on Ad spend [ROAS] is looking a little bit low. How do I get that higher? And that's probably when they talk to Steven [Horne] themselves and they say, ok, how can I make more money from my money? And he might actually suggest you know, drop your bids over here and raise them over there when you're looking at an aggregate view. And that would be like you're bidding too much on chocolate, but chocolates actually, like you pay 30% less for the keyword. Yes, there's less traffic but you're not bidding enough to win all the traffic. So, I think that came out of your suggested search terms stuff Sarah, where you had one advertiser. It's like I actually go for all the misspellings because I'm not spending an absolute ton of money.

So, the quickest way is obviously, oh, I need to up my bid, so I'm going to up the bid and click save [in the Quick Edit Modal]. Otherwise, if my campaign is going underneath and I'm a little bit confused as to why. I can, hopefully this should actually give me a lot more Ads. Oh, it's got none. Beautiful. Never mind back to banners. Obviously, we have the campaign report page. So that's how I can see how it's doing. So, if it had a massive drop off or something like that, I can kind of diagnose.

If you're winning, but you're ok to risk losing you, you just drop your [max] bid. Like if I go from 4 cents to 3 cents, let's see how much I win. So, advertisers with the time to actually check, might drop the bid in the morning and come back in the afternoon and seeing if they just completely dropped off to their competitors. If not, then they're like, sweet. I'm paying my maximum is less. Now, you got the whole second price option business where like maybe they're actually only paying 1 cent per click.

So, you might have a marketing manager who spends less time in AdManager but still comes into AdManager kind of thing and manages across Google ads, whatever.

And then like Woolworths [account managers] are like, well I can't really help you there unless you target all these little ones [keywords]. See it kind of goes down to in order of size of business.

Just go and see how you go. Like I see this is a massive one for agencies because agencies work off that. Like, it needs to spend all across these days and we've had Nectar [Nectar360, UK] ask as well. Like, can you just turn on daily spend for agencies and no one else?

"Alright, so the core funds, they have a required spend. So I'm not trying to get additional spend out of them [brands]. They have Ad dollars to spend for the financial year. A lot of them try to allocate this based on where the revenue is coming from. So right now, I think based on Coles recent financials, it's like 5% of total sales come from online [retail media]. So they would take 5% of their total advertising budget for Coles and use it online. I think then that's how most of them operate. And then it's just a matter of how much of that budget does it, do they allocate to AdManager? And how much they allocate to, you know, packages like we were just talking about. So, as far as like deciding on what a budget looks like, I tend to use... It's not budget pacing, it's literally just looking at how much does a dairy product, for example, a milk product spend on a weekly basis.

So, everyone's got a that and I think budget pacing is much more important where you've got a lot of budget and I guess you don't want to burn through it all. Because you want to allocate some of it to some of your smaller brands or what-not. So I think I've seen daily spending used by Colgate. That's a good example. I think they would really benefit from budget pacing, specifically. Just because they put 20 grand [$20,000] in, can get spent [use completely] in two weeks when they actually budgeted for 2 months spend, right. So they applied daily spends instead, but daily spending just doesn't give them Ads the whole day. It gives them Ads at the start of whenever they activated their campaign. That a really confusing part of daily spending, by the way. They activate based on a rolling 24-hour window* rather than a start of the day, type thing. So, a reason why I think day-parting at the very least would be handy for that daily spending.

Let's look at two days [on the campaign report screen]. So you can see like there's a portion of the day, no clicks. That's where they lost daily spending. And then today hasn't really finished at all. And I think they're about to reset daily spend again. Examples where they're using daily spend to contain their budgets. But they're obviously having to miss out on certain times of the day [as shown in a dip in the spend graph on the Report screen] as a result which I think campaign budget pacing would resolve. May I ask there it, sorry to jump in Sarah. But may I what happens? What's your advice to Colgate it if something like that happens? What do you give them as a suggestion and what they could do to fix that? I mean, if they're trying to show more often, they got two options. They can [1] reduce their bid, which will give them a lower click price [max bid], AKA more clicks at lower price. So probably going to last longer doing that. And I got a caution to them that lowering your click price also lowers your position the auction. So there's every chance you get less sales at the same time. So it's not perfect, it's not ideal. But it's a good option if you need to maintain a daily spend. Otherwise, if you increase your daily spend, you would probably resolve this downtime here.

"It's probably Always On [spend]. Like generally speaking, Always On it's kind of a total spend. It kind of will allocate budget wherever needed. And a lot of the times brands are able to reduce their prices by changing the bids and then their budget lasts longer as a result, right. So they can manipulate their pacing manually. So I think as long as people are trained then Always On is usually preferred. And I think it is doing the majority out of the three spend types. But daily spend is used when brands are starting to get like either tight on their budgets, like they're not being given additional budget, their budgets aren't growing. Or I guess they're starting to have like recently, for example, Mars PetCare had a very large surge in their costs, because they, I believe had a competitor enter the market, or enter the banner a auction and that really jumped up their costs to win the auctions. And then, basically they're Always On budget started spending very, very quickly. So, if they had daily spends’ on [set up] that would never have become a problem. If they had total spend budget pacing or whatever, that would have also not been a problem.

You'll see here, it's basically based on the amount of money they've [brands have in their wallets] got right now, how much they spent last week. And therefore how much [budget], if they spent the same last week as this week, when would they reach zero? So that's what I pace.

Some people have a number in mind at the start. So starting with that, you know, it's 5 grand [$5000] to start with, 20 grand [$20,000] to start with whatever.

Is that actually going to be a positive profitable experience or at least 100% ROI or higher. You can't guarantee it? So, the number I get from suppliers is super variable based on the way we charge for costs. So, the solution you guys have of budget pacing is literally just so that they don't overspend. That's all I can think of.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yeah. Get the most ROI is hard to say. They've all got that not like that ideal in the back of their mind. But I think generally they'll start to notice if they're winning enough or not winning enough. I would say a big problem that will come up with budget pacing is if someone gives me 20 grand [$20,000] as a budget, and then we just budget pace all their campaigns out. There's like no way of knowing that that's going to spend and fulfill, I guess a lot of the Ad space you have. So I would say if you are still trying to maximise the amount of dollars they actually attribute to AdManager and we don't get these situations where the amount they spend is never really reaching zero. I don't contact people that are up in this like year range [brands with ample budget left in wallets]. You know, these guys are basically spending in line to spend [their expected budget] within a year's time. This is like potentially just underspending [leaving money in their wallets]. It is potentially not showing many Ads, maybe they're 10th in the auction or something. It's like not where I want brands spending to be at. And I don't think this is what retailers want either [unspent budgets]. Retailers want this [wallets near zero so brands continue to spend and top-up budgets]. Budgets that are near zero, new budgets coming into AdManager allocating out of other avenues that they otherwise were going to put their money into. The whole point of this is if you're using campaign budgeting, which is going to limit the amount of time these Ads get shown. For example, if a budget was only going to last one tenth of the time if you ran it Always On [spend], but we want to run it for 10 times the length you have to show that Ad one every one tenth of a day, basically. That is still going to give you a very small impression shared number. So if you want to keep budgets increasing, people need to know that they've actually limited the amount of Ads they get. So impression share needs to be correct essentially, which is not the case at all. But that's my big problem with daily spending [limits]. Daily spending [limits] reduces your impression share number, typically.

So either you should be looking at reducing your [max] bids or increasing your daily budgets to accommodate for that, get yourself seen more often in the day. It's not usually brands telling me this is the metric I'm looking at and I want to improve it. It's me going to them and going you're missing out and you should change something about your campaign.

"I got a few people up-voting this one in Canny [requests], so I'll show you that. So right now [shared Canny ticket titled ""Changing Impression Share Calculation""], impression share calculated by impressions you've received on your actually served Ad compared to total Ad requests made by the retailer. So usually what you'll see is this [in the Imp Share column on the campaign Reports screen in AdManager], you got a huge denominator [e.g. 76440], small numerator [e.g. 3428]. It's not ideal at all. Now sometimes it's accurate-ish, for example, you can have times where things look above 50% which is probably correct. The issue is though there's like 20[%] to 30% actually of impressions that are missed on Coles. And that's to do with an Ad time-out that they have imposed. Like if a page doesn't load quickly, Coles just cut out certain Ads including AdManager, so you can lose out on impressions like that. So impression share to me was not accurate enough. It's not telling me actually, what share [Share of Voice] are they [brands] getting of the impressions that are available to them. A more accurate way of determining impression shares should be the amount of impressions received. So that's the same metric obviously but compare that to the total amount of impressions that that search term actually got rather than the Ad requests [from retailers] for the search term.",Share of Voice, AdManager, Operations, Business challenge, Missed opportunity, Understanding vague, Gap (Product or Service), Brand needs, Impressions, Coles,,,,,,,,,
"Like you, you could show both, maybe. You could show how much Ad request Coles are trying to make so that could be like the total opportunity, but the amount of share you've got, the percentage share should reflect you versus competitors so that they can see exactly what they miss out if they don't bid more or they don't increase their budget more [as current SOV metrics is reflected as a number]. The whole idea of impression share from my understanding is to increase the amount of costs that is incurred by the supplier by changing their bids, increasing their budgets. And this is wrong. This is completely, basically creates a terrible result, especially for aisles. Your aisle number can be wild. This is 2.5 million impressions because your Ad requests are coming from every aisle. So yeah, this number is completely flawed. I can't even use it. So I need brands to know that if they impose constraints on their budgets like low bids, low daily spends, a campaign budget pacer that they're going to be losing out on something. So there needs to be an indicator to them that doing so ultimately reduces the Ad space that you win, the sales you get, the impressions you receive, so on.",Spend Limits / Cap-outs, Competitor data, Impressions, Ad requests, Brand needs, Coles, Missed opportunity, Concern or Worry, Performance, Bench-marking, Metrics, Bidding, Share of Voice,,,,,,
"Yeah, I can. So this one here [shared campaign Reports screen]. An ideal pace is something that's still getting over 50% impression share while using their pacing. And that's it. Like they're basically getting a good amount of impressions while also within their budget. I'd say another side like it's possible that, like this one here, this one is not getting many if any impressions because they are spending through their budget really quickly. And the way they're doing that is via high maximum bids. If they reduce their bid they would get like maybe, twice as many clicks or whatever, last longer in the day and therefore hit that daily budget less often and therefore show more impressions. So if there's a budget pacer, it would even have to be able to reduce bids so you can get higher impressions throughout the day whilst maintaining a certain budget they have that day. Or, I don't know how you're going to pace this out. Could be daily, could be weekly, whatever. That's ultimately what I'm trying to get brands to do is to try and get [them to] keep their Ad active as much as they can given a [set] budget and therefore improve their impression share as high as I can get it.",Pacing, Advice and guidance, Impressions, AdManager, Budget, Reporting, Bidding,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yeah, if you reduce your bid, it means you've got less cost per click [CPC] to run, which can mean more clicks overall, more impressions overall and a greater impression share as a result. So ironically, if they use a daily spend [limit], it suddenly changes my whole strategy because they've given me the maximum amount that they can spend every day. So if we're trying to get the most Ad space, because I don't want these guys to, to pause [stop servicing Ads] out each day. If they pause their Ad throughout the day, they're no longer in our auctions. So, you've, you've literally removed someone bidding $5 a click if they hit their daily spend. So, you've got less competition over overall if people hit a spend number. I think a good thing with campaign budget pacing or whatever is going to be hopefully keeping that guy in the auction or keeping that supplier in the auction with whatever bid they have. So hopefully that's part of the algorithm as well so you're not pulling yourself out of the auction with a [budget] pacer. It's just using this bid no matter what. Because ultimately, I'm trying to prevent people from leaving the auction each day because I need to keep a second competitor, or third competitor in the auction to make sure this number [max bid amount] stays as high as I can get it.

"Yeah. If you want to reduce this number to something tangible, it has to reflect the next competitor in the auction. So in this case, the next competitor for dishwashing is, it was $4.80 at least today and yesterday. So you need to reduce your bid at least to below $4.80 to suddenly reduce your overall costs and last longer in the auction that day. You know, if someone's running on, I'm not trying to reduce their bid, they don't need to. But if someone's using a daily spend [limit], then if they're reaching zero constantly each day, I've got less competitors in the auction to be a second price for someone else.

"Consequences for me, and AKA this is more a retailer problem, is there's less competitors on the rest of the week. I personally, whenever someone asks, can I day-part or can I activate for specific days. Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, for example, that's typically a peak trading. I know it's ironic here, but that's typically actually Thursday, Friday. Yeah, doing that allocating all your budget to here and losing your budgets here gives me less competitors in the option for the rest of the week. So, thinking about it now, Google Ads, that's where I see day-parting used so much. And that's quite useful for them because they have a humongous network and they could never reach full 100% impression share for every search term, right. It's kind of impossible for them, so they can offer day-parting and what-not and reduce the amount of budget and burn that brands are spending, or whoever's spending just because they don't literally can't spend an infinite amount of money out of people's pockets, but with somewhere like Coles, you can have your budgets last the full week. It's possible and it's not infinite. There's not an infinite amount of impressions in here, at least compared to Google, which if you factor in bots and stuff, it's literally infinite.

There's going to be people out there that do use active periods. They have a launch date for their new product or something. It's going to happen in the 1st of September, whatever it is. So that's where your budget pacing is going to be quite helpful. They've planned ahead, they've got this much money, they've got a one-month promo period or whatever. But I try to get people to not do that. Where another [Canny request] feature comes in handy, it's called like active [campaign] period start date, not end date, I believe Jen [Garner] linked me that.",Budget, Missed opportunity, Pacing, Ad serving, Concern or Worry, Follow-up, Brands, Value or belief,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yeah, this one [Canny request] ability to start a campaign start date with no end date. And that is actually really important if we're trying to keep people's Ads going because they still have budget, right. And they still have a total spend. Whatever that's really why I think this [Canny request] exists, because we're leaving money on the table if we don't get rid of that end date. Yeah, so there's a few different solutions which ultimately might come to the same conclusion of trying to increase people's budgets or increase people's spend with the budgets they got. Anyway, that's a few different features. I think that need to be implemented all at once.",Canny, Brand needs, Underspending, Missed opportunity, UI improvements, Campaigns, Date or Time related,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I'm going to say depends on the user's experience. [An] inexperienced user that has probably never used an Ad platform before, literally won't even try to hover over it [campaign state indicator with tool-tip], for example. So I think that was partially why we have this like, you know, first log in, there's a tool-tip that comes up [Userflow onboarding messages] and shows you, this is a, a wallet balance notification or whatever this is your approval state or you know, that kind of thing. There's a little pop up that comes up at the start. Without education, this literally doesn't get used. So when people ask me the question is because they haven't actually looked at the campaign budget daily budget. So I'd take a screenshot like this [of the campaign dashboard] if you're curious like do that.",Wallets, Guidance, Mental models, Userflow, UI, Support,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Like it's not that high a priority to me. I know retailers probably couldn't care less about this, but I know some suppliers want it because, like Colgate they've got finite budgets, they need to make these last longer. And that's how they can do it. They can add these campaign budget pacers to do that. Like I am hesitant for that feature because, you know, sometimes this becomes a problem. Ultimately, I think your budget pacing tool would eliminate daily spend requirements, right? So people could just budget pace out how much this campaign gets for a certain amount of time and that way they can get rid of their daily spend. And that might stop me from having to tell people, hey, you should reduce your bid to keep yourself in the auction longer, get higher impression share. That's not something I want to tell suppliers. I would much rather they keep their [max] bid high. And that way, you know, high competition, next person who overtakes and pays a lot. If you put a budget pacing tool in there, that could be a way of making sure that they are able to keep bidding this the whole day. Instead of being dropped out of the auction halfway through with their daily spend. So I see value in it. I see some brands need it. At least for Coles, it's not huge, but I can see the US network making a lot of use out of it because you're, you're suddenly reaching a much larger branch, a much larger audience. And they're not going to necessarily have all that extra budget for it. Kind of depends on the size of the retailer, but for Coles, it's not that important. This is a small challenge I have trying to make sure daily spends are designed in a way to keep Ads going as much as I can get them to go. But it's not my main priority. One of the major priorities I have is notifications or wallets and that would be a lifesaver. Yeah, that's probably how I'd prioritise things. I've got a few other things in the future [Canny] requests.",Auctions, Notifications, Bidding, Colgate-Palmolive, Concern or Worry, Share of Voice, Retailers, Business challenge, Impressions, Value or belief, Wallets, USA, Spend Limits / Cap-outs, Pacing, Competitor, Budget,,,
"The best solution for pacing would be this day spend to not pull you out of the auction, the moment you spend that amount of money. I'd much rather this day spend, try and pace itself each day. I think it tries to, but I just know it doesn't. So the ultimate thing I'd want is, if it's $250 a day, they spend through it in half the day, [then] try and show their Ad for maybe half an hour each hour or every second minute. I don't know how quickly you can get this to go. But that way you're keeping a competitor in the auction for someone above them. That's really all I care about. I know not every retailer uses daily spend by the way, like Woolies. So I can't say that solution's perfect. It might get them to use daily spends again. Which should be cool. I don't want to say it's useless. It's not going to kill revenue. It's probably useful for brands that have total spends and an active period, right. But that's few and far between. It's not that many brands on Coles that do it. So, it's on the priority list. It's just not that high. If that makes sense.",Pacing, Spend, Brand needs, Coles, Recommendation, Competitor, Spend Limits / Cap-outs, Woolworths,,,,,,,,,,,
"That's extra balance they have. So, that's an interesting question as well. Let's say someone wants to guarantee they spend $700 a week. They'll put $100 daily spend [limit]. But then they hit their daily budget maybe half the time and then the other half they don't hit it. And ultimately what just happened was instead of spending 700 bucks [$700] that week, they spent like [$]500. That genuinely happens because of daily spends the way it works right now. So, that's, that's another reason why I think, daily spending is kind of flawed. So, there's a good reason to argue that daily spend shouldn't exist and campaign budget pacing should. I can't give you a perfect answer here on what the solution should be. I'll leave that to you experts.",Pacing, Business challenge, Spend Limits / Cap-outs, Budget,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But this would be so handy for like every retailer, by the way. I remember this was so important early on and it didn't exist. There was a time where I was at AdManager and then we didn't have DataGrid, we didn't have Peter [Ilic] for example. So this report [shared spreadsheet 'Coles AdManager - Specific Wallet Tracker'] is impossible to make in AdManager. So yeah, it's been very helpful, but it's still very manual.

"What information do we get? Ok, for a retailer, they get campaign level which is not great. And they also don't get to see how much team balances are in that report either. So it's like even if they tried to pull this themselves, they would get stuck [shared campaign reports for Coles instance of AdManager]. Basically, it's literally not possible through the platform. And that's another way of saying the data that they can pull out, AKA campaign level one week which also uses, what is this reporting called this tool? Anyway, whatever data we use to pull this costs money every time you do it. Whereas DataGrid costs us a flat fee per month or week or whatever it is. Even if they did try and make my tracker [spreadsheet] every week, that would be a costly solution, which is very tedious. Like you see that you have to like collect every wallet from every team. Like I'm glad I got this [spreadsheet] to a point where it's automated, sort of, I get one report. It flunks this all together for me in one go. Yeah, but it takes a lot of effort, right. You see that's one 'if' statement [used in the spreadsheet]. So not the best solution and I wish there was something that just kind of did this right away. And I think SmartCart has one for DataGrid. The current solution they would have to try and do is take the campaign-level report, build a CSV for that, pivot table everything into like wallets, team name, all that and then try and build a burn [spend] rate sheet from it.

So, that's why I did it. It's super helpful for me in my job and I think it's replicable with literally you take this report, and you change the retailer, that's AU [Australia] Coles, and then, this kind of plonks out for them from that report. But I'm pretty sure DataGrid can do this, and that would be a much better solution for every other retailer out there. We can just give them that report in a DataGrid sheet and they can change the order of these wallets or whatever to see burn rate [spend] and stuff. So yeah, that's ultimately what I'd prefer. There's a little bit of knowledge you need to do to make this work properly [showed retailer wallet spend in spreadsheet]. And I think, me as the creators is the reason I can do it.

So then I'm working with the client and basically, it's just, it's all kind of assigned through HubSpot. Or we have like an account list and then we use HubSpot and then we kind of go into AdManager. So here's Kraft [shared AdManager UI] and there are a lot. So these are all search only placements. You can't really see how many pages there are but if we click through, you can see that there's going to be several across the few placements we have PDP which is broad display category, search, share Cheadar cart.

It includes display media, it includes Banner-X media and everything lives in here. So you can see right now we're running a back-to-school display program that lives in here.

"So every campaign is different. This originally launched with one wallet that can move fluidly across the auction campaigns. The client has come back and said we need to map out budgets by business units [Kraft business units]. So now we have a few different wallets for just that search portion. Some clients are different. They can have one fluid budget, so we'll just have one wallet. They might say we need to have brands by retailer. And if they're targeting six retailers, then we'll have six specific wallets. They might say we need budgets by brand. So basically every client's different. But those would be the 3 major either just [1] one overarching, [2] budget by brand or [3] budget by retailer.

"I mean, it's usually coming from the client because I feel like our team prefers one wallet, one budget that can move fluidly across all campaigns and then spend where there's the most demand. That's like my always 'go-to' recommendation because then you're not limiting any of the budget. Like maybe American cheese [for Kraft] is spending a lot but it it's done, it's spent its budget but Pickles is pacing behind and we could technically shift some budget. So I like to do the one budget. But clients will tell me if they need it [wallets set up] by retailer or by brand. So that information is coming from the client. So in this case, he said we need Hy-Vee shop right broken out and then you can put all the smaller retailers in this general multi-retailer wallet. Whereas I think it is [Procter & Gamble] Home Care told us, hey, we need budgets by brand. Like we can't, whatever Tide [P&G laundry product] has gained can't spend. So then in this campaign, we actually broke the wallets out by [P&G] brand. So each client is a little different. It's this is unique, like these two were Procter and Gamble, P&G campaigns. But one of their, their Home Care team said we want it this way. But then their Fabric Care team said we want a different way.

"So basically, it's what is the budget for what timeline. A lot of these bigger clients I'm working with are on, like a 12-month contract. And so we have to figure out like how much have they spent of the budget, how much is remaining. But then I also back into what should they have spent if they were pacing evenly. So, you know, if we have $100,000 budget across five months, they should be spending $20,000 to pace evenly. And if I see that they've only spent $12,000 in the first month, then I know that they're pacing behind and we need to try to like increase pacing to spend a little bit faster, to try to catch up so that we can spend that budget in [the] fall.",Budget, Overspending, Brands, Routine activity, Pacing, Contracts, Underspending, Advice and guidance, Spend,,,,,,,,,,
"Yeah, let me share my screen again. So that pacing doc, that one just rolled out, so I'm not as like using that as my 100%, always look at it. I'm still like moving over to using it. But I have like weekly or bi-weekly calls with all of my clients. So I actually map out what it's looking like. So like for General Mills, they have budgets by brand [shared a Google spreadsheet for General Mills budget pacing]. And so every time I have a call with them, I pull the data from the UI, the search data, and then I sort it by wallet so that I can separate out the brands. And then I provide the client, what we've spent out of the annual budget and what we should have spent based on that calculation I just shared with you looking at, how much time has run versus how much time has been left and figure out like where we should have spent by now. So this is kind of an example here that I work through with the client. And then, we also look at performance to then figure out optimisations together in real time. Do we need to slow the pacing down? Do we need to set daily caps? Or are we pacing behind? Should we try to open up Annie's [General Mills Mac & Cheese brand] outside of macaroni and cheese and add in some more of the portfolio which we did here adding crackers and cookies, et cetera.

Let's set some daily caps to ensure that this budget lasts your fiscal year. Are we pacing behind? What can we do to try to pick that up.

So we launched cereal on the paid wallet, which is this wallet here [wallet named 'Cereal_General Mills_FY22_Hyvee_534']. But now you can see that in this note, I said the $11,000 of added-value is running uncapped, paid media is paused. So right now all the paid media is paused and just the added-value media is live. And we have to have added-value [budget] on a separate wallet and labelled [wallet named 'Auction_AVS_CEREAL_General Mills_FY33'] or else the finance team doesn't know it's truly an added-value and they would charge for it, right?",Spend, Wallets, FTA (Fixed Tenancy Ads), General Mills, Budget,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yeah, that's OK. I'm actually not going to use Kraft as an example just because there's a lot going on and I would need to like pull a bunch of data to get a holistic view of it. Let's just use this General Mills Hy-Vee because we have the data and I know it's much cleaner. There's a lot of teams as you can see, it's somewhere around here [shared General Mills instance of AdManager UI]. So what would we do to optimise? So first off, Annie's was pacing behind [shown in the pacing spreadsheet] and so I really wanted to focus on adding more products. So my first kind of step to optimise is see if the client will approve to add additional SKU’s from Annie's [GM's mac and cheese brand] portfolio, which they did here. So that was kind of like one of my first agenda items is get those Ad SKU’s, and which would then ultimately add keywords. So that's kind of one way to optimise. Then what we've done here is Betty Crocker [GM's food brand], I see is pacing ahead. So with that, knowing that we are pacing a little bit faster than where we should be. And that this budget's kind of small to last 12 months, had recommended to apply daily caps so that it's not necessarily going to, help it. It might not help performance, it might help performance. But we want to ultimately slow down pacing here. So we set daily caps on Betty Crocker, probably a few other brands. A few other things I like to look at is return on ad spend [ROAS]. So what is performing really strongly? You know, fruit snacks here on Annie's has 810% return on ad spend. It has barely spent anything but it is generating strong returns. We could try to bump up this max CPC, maybe to like 250 [adjusted the GM pacing spreadsheet lime-item to $2.50 on the max bid] just to see if maybe we can win some more slots. And maybe we can continue to like boost the spending on this campaign while keeping return on ad spend strong.",Spend, Hy-Vee, Optimisation, Gap (Product or Service), Advice and guidance, Manual effort, Budget, Overspending, Managed service, Campaigns, Spend Limits / Cap-outs, Hack or Workaround, Pacing, Data, Search terms / Keywords, General Mills, Google spreadsheet, SKU, ROAS
"These are all just static [values in the GM pacing spreadsheet] that this is strictly pulled from the UI, so there are no equations in any of this data. It's all just like numbers pulled from the UI. The only equations are here [in the spreadsheet running sub-totals] where I'm literally just summing up the cost and I'm manually calculating the 'Should have spent'. So, when I'm going through with clients and going through this data and talking about recommendations if they're like, yeah, I'm aligned to increase my CPC on fruit snacks. I'll usually just like mark it in yellow and change it [in the pacing spreadsheets] and then kind of use this as my action item when I'm off the call to go make the changes in the platform. From here, if you want to dig in a little bit further to decide if we need to increase the CPC, then what we can do is let's go back into Annie's [General Mills brand]. For example, I'm going to click view report [in AdManager] to get into that granular view. We can take a look at search terms and hone in on the average Ad rank. Because average Ad rank, you want to be between 1 through 5 [for slot placements]. If you're any higher than five, that indicates you're not winning the top slots. You should increase your CPC. So Annie's looks good right here [displayed Avg Ad rank for Annie’s as 3 in AdManager UI]. But, it's clearly a timely task because I need to go through each like brand. But then within each brand, there's those own campaigns that fall under that brand. So we kind of need to dig in a little bit more when making optimisations and looking at average Ad rank is definitely helpful to determine if we should increase CPC's. But as you can see, we kind of have to go into each one in a granular motion. Other than that, let's just go back here and go back to Annie's [brand] as an example. Actually let me use something that's been live a little bit longer. This gluten-free cereal ['Auction_Cereal_Gluten Free' wallet within the pacing spreadsheet]. You know, we might want to try to boost the return on Ad spend. Sorry, actually, this one's not live. That's a bad example too. Just trying to find something with lower ROAS here. Let's use Nature Valley [found 'Auction_Nature Valley' wallet in spreadsheets and then searched for in AdManager UI] at 123% [ROAS]. And so from here, what we can do is look at Nature Valley [campaign], let's go into view report and look at the SKU's. And this campaign might benefit from removing some lower performing SKU's. So I just sorted it by cost [in campaign Report] to see what SKU’s are spending the most of the dollars. And, overall some of these returns are pretty low. For example, you know, these two [Nature Valley Honey and Brown Sugar line-items] haven't spent a lot in the past seven days. This has spent around $100 but right here, 24 of those dollars, which is about 25% of the spend is going towards these two SKU’s [Nature Valley Cinnamon and Peanut Butter line-items] that aren't generating positive returns on the sales. So here's another example of SKU’s that I might recommend pausing so that the budget can go to those SKU’s that are actually converting and people are purchasing, and they have a stronger return on Ad spend.",AdManager, Limitation, Bidding, Spend, Pacing, ROAS, UI, Placements, Wallets, Managed service, Google spreadsheet, Optimisation, Campaigns, Reporting, CPC (Cost Per Click), Advice and guidance, Hack or Workaround, Performance, Manual effort
"So you would go into Edit campaign and then you would go next to the Advertised Product section. And from here you would find those two SKU’s and just hit the X button. So when I say pausing, we're basically removing them from the campaign. And then once I remove them you just hit next through all of the stages and then submit it again and then you're good to go.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yeah, I would say it depends on the brands. You might have some smaller challenger brands that are like, hey, I only have 5 SKU’s or less. I've had campaigns that are like, hey, I have two SKU’s and that's all I want to run. Then you've got, these brands [like General Mills] that have a lot of SKU’s and in that case, we usually say, yeah send over as many as you want. But then we kind of need to take a step back after we have some data and figure out like maybe all of these SKU’s aren't working to their benefit. So you get both ends of it and just need to work with what you have. But if you have too many SKU’s, like I said, their top seller, maybe like their lowest performing product because of the way the algorithm works and relevancy is tied in, like it could be showing the products that just we know don't convert the most [low Conversion Rates]. Or the client knows that that doesn't convert the most. And so because of that, we might want to consider removing them up.",Managed service, General Mills, SKU, Analysis, Business challenge, Relevancy, Products, Brands, Conversion Rates, Performance,,,,,,,,,
"Great question [on pacing]. I mean, ideally we should be touching this program at least once a week, but probably more like 2 times a week and that's across all of these campaigns. To be honest, I've been so underwater for like months that I'm not touching these as much as I should be. But then, we're transitioning accounts right now and trying to open up my bandwidth. So I know I'll be able to spend more time on these, but we really should be touching them at least once a week. But obviously I know like all the CSM's have a lot of work right now. So there's sometimes where the campaign isn't getting touched that week.",Optimisation, Staffing or Resourcing, Campaigns, Routine activity, Managed service, Pacing, Manual effort,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Well, I mean, having that pacing doc [Google pacing spreadsheet] is definitely a good start. It can indicate what's under-pacing, but then you can dig into it and see like the individual campaigns [line-items] within that campaign. But, you know how I had to sort by wallets to then pace by brand. I think having a cleaner view that way. And maybe helping and the pacing doc [spreadsheet] might calculate what should have been spent by now. But just having a cleaner [view] because, you saw my report like I'm sorting that and I'm separating them out and then I'm pulling, spends by each of the brands. So something that you can kind of view it a little bit more like that. Obviously, we can organise it into one, but just to get like, how is Annie's [General Mills brand] across all of its campaigns doing versus having to like add up all of the Annie's lines [campaign line-items]. What else would make pacing? Automatic alerts if we could get email alerts that say your wallet is out of balance or your wallet is under $750, like it already does. Because, just knowing that we're super busy [and] sometimes I don't catch it and I haven't touched a campaign in a week and then I go look, I'm like, oh my gosh, the wallets out of funds, it hasn't ran for 5 days. But also the wallet shouldn't be out of funds. Like maybe the [Ad] Op's team put in the wrong budget and I haven't noticed for five days because I haven't touched that campaign. If we could get an email alert that says General Mills Hy-Vee, Annie's wallet out of funds, then that would like kind of put the pressure on me to jump into that right away and not get to it when I have time and then figure out the wallet's been out [of funds] for five days.",General Mills, Hack or Workaround, Pacing, Underspending, Performance, Spend, Campaigns, Wallets, Staffing or Resourcing, Notifications, Hy-Vee, Manual effort, Google spreadsheet,,,,,,
"So right now, we use HubSpot as like a campaign management tool which everyone agrees it's not really the best campaign management tool. And we just started using Jira to enter tickets for campaign launches and any type of like change request that is a new process. So we're kind of double-up'ing with HubSpot and Jira right now. So, I do my work in Jira, but I'm not like 100% doven into Jira because I'm doing duplicate work in two systems. So I'm kind of just like, let me get it done and move on to the next thing.

"So you're saying it would evenly pace across like the 5 Annie's campaigns? Not just one campaign? Oh, yeah, I would totally use it. That's kind of our pain-point with daily caps right now. Daily caps are set at the campaign level, not the wallet level. So if you're like, I want to spend $50 a day because we're pacing ahead, you have to like, ok, maybe it's $10 across five campaigns that equals $50 a day. But those campaigns might, you know, Mac and Cheese might spend the whole [$]10 and crackers might not spend it. And so, they're doing right now a manual wallet capping test. So that instead of using daily caps, we just apply the $50 a day to the wallet every day. So, like manually at 9 a.m. the [Ad] Op's teams going in and adding funds to all of these wallets. That's kind of our work around. But if you had a more automated way to cap a campaign on a daily budget but not do a daily cap by campaign, do it more at the wallet level. That would be really cool.",Spend Limits / Cap-outs, Wallets, Manual effort, Pain points, Pacing, Campaigns,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Oh, I would absolutely love it if the system could do it because as you know, we might not hit that $50 daily cap. If we hit [$]45 we should recalculate because to take those funds that we didn't spend, it's going to make that cap a little bit larger [i.e. add $5 unspent from one day to the following days cap of $50, so it will spend $55 in total the following day].

"In most cases, the clients don't care.  You might get a few clients that say, hey, can we day-part? Which means can we just run the Ads from 8 am to 6 pm because how many people are shopping at 2 a.m. So you have some clients asking for that. Obviously, right now, that's manual. We would have to pause [a campaign manually] it and turn it on during those times. For the most part, we always recommend and Always On [spend] approach. With the AdManager platform, Always On is best, it helps get your relevancy score increased. But there have been asks [by brands] for day-parting. So, if that's ever something you can add, that would be a nice option. Other than that, there are clients that are like, hey, we're, we want to ramp up right before the holiday because shopping trips increase or hey, we're running a promotion on our product, buy two, get the third free. We want to kind of heavy up [advertise and spend more] there. So there are certain cases where there's times where they want to kind of boost it [spend] even more. But other than that, I would say, kind of the Always On approach is pretty standard unless we have to daily cap because we're going too fast.",Day-parting, Overspending, AdManager, Manual effort, Brands, Spend,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Yeah, I think what we've built is great, but I will say it's very manual. It becomes very tedious, which becomes very timely. And we are very busy over here, lots of campaigns to manage.

"Yeah, definitely keep me posted if you want to talk again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yeah. And one more piece on that is because I've experienced both sides of it where you're not pacing. Like it's really hard to spend and obviously we're trying to pull triggers there. But then I've had the other side where we've paced too fast and the client is upset. And so then they're like, well, I want to make good and we have to give them added-value because we spent their budget too fast, which is kind of like silly to say. So there's kind of those two ends of the spectrum. So if there's a way to try to automate to spend evenly, so if I don't touch it for three days, we didn't blow through the budget. Like I have that kind of safety net. Because that's happened too where in January, like one of our campaigns spent thousands and thousands and thousands and it wasn't supposed to spend that much. But that's, you know, New Year people are buying like they wanted those products. But then the client was unhappy that a portion of their budget was spent so quickly.

But the other side of that is that I also managed the banners and also other side of performance marketing. So I think in a nutshell, it's kind of like, how do we spend the budget more efficiently to get them like the best results. So for each dollar spent, how do we maximise the ROI. So that would be looking after again, different channels, looking after different opportunities, doing a lot of testing and in terms of like budget, if we spend more, if we cut down the bids, or if we pull the Ads for branded terms.

"Yeah, actually let me have a look. I basically looked at how we spend previously. So for example, I think we used to spend around [$]50K a month when I picked up the account six months ago. So I just tend to spend similar amount. Although sometimes we have new testing like aisles or category, then we'll spend more. However, based on what we're seeing so far over the last 30 days or so after lockdown, we're actually spending a lot more. Which is around. I think around [$]80K a month. So again, depending on historical performance and also depending on the volume, how much we need to spend, if the ROI is good, when I say good, it's around probably six or seven, then we can definitely spend more. So that's how I look at the budget. Yeah, I do have it break it down by month.

"I'll show you what I mean by that. So basically we would have to budget but not by product. So what I mean is that if you look at July, I have a July budget for all the products. So I would go to campaigns, and I'll look at the top (when it loads), I'll look at the top [of the Campaign Report screen]. So I'll just look at these columns [Cost, Spend and ROAS] and make sure that we don't go over budget. So as I mentioned before, I would spend [$]50K per month, so that is fine. ROI is quite good, so 677[%]. And I'll just see how much the bid is. So bid [Cost] is something I'll use. I wouldn't go into every single campaign to look at each of them because we are not tracking towards... we don't have targets towards every single one of them.

So I normally pick Always On, unless it's a super like de-prioritised campaign and I don't want to spend a fortune. Then I would almost always pick Always On. And then the maximum cost per click, I would firstly look at these bids, minimum bids. Obviously, we have to go above 1.80 [$1.80 minimum bid amount]. But also, I changed that from time to time looking at what competitors are bidding on. How high or how low we've been ranking and then I'll adjust it accordingly.

"I do and I have a feedback for you guys. So I use that a lot and what I realised was that we always go over this limit [monthly Credit Limit of $20,000].

So I was panicking when I went into Woolworths and obviously it's not showing and I didn't know what's going on.

So the [$]800,000 is a hard limit. But having said that I've been checking on that, which is why it gave us [$]200K room.

Whereas Sainsbury's for example, work very closely with their suppliers to try and make sure that each different wallet has attached PO's [Purchase Orders] to it.

So the first day and you've got the budget over 24-hour and when the next day starts, the next piece of cake, the next piece of budget is going to enter. And right now this is this moving 24-hour window, which is just confusing. That's the most common questions I've got. The other thing is about - it's not directly connected to pacing - it's about overspend. So sometimes because if the daily budget is low comparing to the amount of traffic and the CPC, there could be some overspending because we simply cannot stop the serving Ads in in the right time because of the of the volume of the Ads.

So if you've got, you know, if you've got somebody coming in and saying, right, we're going to cap it at £30 a day and they hit that £30 at midday. They're not pushing them out to spend and keep the auction going for the rest of the day. If you've then got somebody who's only bidding 45p, which is their full price, then they just capture what actually might be some of the more fruitful shoppers.

Most of them are total here if you Always On campaigns. Yeah, the same here, here you are here. You've got two daily budget campaigns total one daily. Always On. Yeah.

We then move across into the campaigns tab. Reiterate these top points here. Talk them through the line graph and the change from conversions into quantity. Talk through the impressions. Talk them through the averages again here. Take them through here and talk to them about the different spend mechanics. So, you know, if you set a campaign budget, it's visible here.

So people won't use it for Wowcher. Feel Unique as in very early days. They may in the long run have agencies, they don't have any at the moment.

"Listen, the fact is if they have got clients and, and because the system is so easily used, they have got clients that if they're not doing it for them, the clients will do it themselves. So they are flexing to make sure that they maintain that, you know, that revenue is coming through, through to them. I'm not saying that we don't need pacing or that there aren't retailers out there, or retailers to come that wouldn't find a pacing mechanic useful. Or if it was something that we could dial in and dial out of that different retailers might actually say, do you know what, yes, we do want pacing and others might say no. It's going to be a very much a personal retailer decision as to how they do this.

"Yeah, usually the question, the answer I provide is that this is the rolling 24-hour window. And if the amount of the traffic is higher than the daily limit, it's going to burn faster.

"Yeah, there was also some questions about this. Because like in real life, this 24-hour window is also adding some more confusion. So there was also a lot of questions, maybe not a lot of a bunch of questions, about why my campaign is like peaking. Like there are a peak of spends in the 24-hour window. But these spikes do not start on the midnight, but rather it starts at some random time of the day.",Campaigns, Insights, Metrics, Spend, Spend Limits / Cap-outs, Confusion,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yeah, and the answer is that's because that's the moment when you start the campaign. It starts to spend the budget and then the budget, it exceed. And then the moving 24-hour window needs to go after that limit. So there will be the next spike. So usually spent for daily budget looks like there was like a two or three hours with campaigns getting impressions and clicks and then nothing but for the rest of the of the day. So 21 hours and then again, the spike. I believe it must look odd for the vendors [suppliers].",Budget, Impressions, Spend Limits / Cap-outs, Limitation, AdManager, Brands,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So here you can see there is early morning and seeing the conversion rate on early morning,. It's like 28[%], 40% and then it goes up to 60[%] on that. And it eventually it goes up even to not over almost 90% on the late of the day [illustrates buyer behaviour at different times of the day]. So yeah, that's what makes me believe that the hourly pacing like that having a possibility to allocate funds in our basis would be something which can be yeah, it's something which can be useful for suppliers.

"No, that was actually the revenue graph. So it's not about the conversion rate, it's about the revenue. So that basically it's connected with a number of the clicks.

"Yeah, I mean, to be honest it has got the potential to go either way, hasn't it? Really? Because you could say they're only going to go for those times, but then if they're all only going for those times it's still going to push the price up, right? So if everyones realised that the best hours are between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m. they're all going to go for it. But it will just see the traffic, any of the traffic kind of coming for the rest of the day could potentially miss out on promoted products. And at the end of the day for the retailers it's not just about how much money we're making through the platform. Obviously, they want their spends up as well in terms of product conversion.

"As for suppliers, I mean, they're always asking us about A/B testing in different ways to test the platform. And you know, we've got people doing it through banner-x and stuff like that. They want to know the difference between what's the activation results while I'm on versus what would that have been if I wasn't there? So they are always trying to test it.

"So the way that we set it up in the US and we're moving away from this little bit to being a wallet level instead of a team level. So each contract we get from a CPG [Consumer Packaged Good supplier], we would set up a new team and then build the line-items or campaigns underneath that to go with that particular contract that we received.

Can you guys see Target [shared Target instance of AdManager]? So SC Johnson [brand] is kind of a beast but is a good example of how we set these campaigns up. It might take a second to load because it's large.,Business challenge, SC Johnson (SCJ), Target, Campaigns, Managed service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ok, I'll take a step back and that we use this sheet [Google spreadsheet to manage Ads and pacing] which I built for our teams to understand how pacing is going. So this is typical of what we would expect. So it has a start and end date. And then the total media spend and what our current spend is and then it calculates and moves these functions. So if we're on track as to where we should be. So this 'should have spent' [column] is also a calculation. This [cell] will turn 'yes' and green [if spend is on track]. And then we also mark if it's been hitting its daily caps [limits] or not. So from there, I read this sheet and from there, I would go here [into Campaign Manager screen in AdManager] and see where we have the ability to increase our caps because we're pacing behind. So let's say Pledge [SC Johnson cleaning product]. I would do this and clearly PDP [Product Display Page budget] for Pledge is not performing how we would expect it to throughout the day. But keyword for Pledge is almost reaching its daily cap at this point in time. So I wo uld remove funds out of here, let's say, at [$]10 or $20 increments at a time depending on what this [budget] numerator looks like and add it into campaigns that are spending better and also driving a higher return. We know that search performs better because it's more intent of searching than a category or PDP [Product Display Page] campaign.

We're allowing the system to use its algorithm, we're allowing the system to just go towards demand whereas we really have to be high-touch in here [for SC Johnson] and shifting back and forth to make sure that the ones that are capping out are getting more money whereas the ones that are not spending are not within that hour time frame.",Business challenge, Spend Limits / Cap-outs, Spend, AdManager, Preference, Manual effort, SC Johnson (SCJ), Budget, Limitation, YouCopia, Aggregated reporting, Products,,,,,,,

We have pretty large budgets, so we try and make sure that those daily caps are [spread] evenly across if they want to be billed by brands. So they want OFF [SCJ pest spray product] campaigns to be billed to the 'OFF' team and the Pledge [SCJ cleaner product] campaigns to be billed to the Pledge teams. So we would take this and when we're doing that calculation [of budget performance], we would filter by Pledge and then see how many campaigns are below [expected spend performance targets] and set up our daily caps based on the number of line-items for that particular wallet so that it spends evenly across [the duration].

So we've been on the e-commerce SmartCart specific Journey for the last maybe 2.5 years. Now. This is like our second full year in the system that we're sort of just starting if we talk to January.

"So I am someone who logs into SmartCart every day. It's just the way sort of I manage our budgets and manage our campaigns.

"And in addition, I manage that budget. The way I like to manage that budget is because we don't necessarily with our product range tie to any particular sales or anything like that. We take an Always On approach to always be as high as possible, for the entire year. So that just dictates to the fact that I'll split our yearly budget up by month, then therefore, I'll split the yearly budget by day. And then I'll be logging in every day to make adjustments, and top up the campaigns based on sort of that spend for today. So that's how sort of, I manage the budgets and sort of how I manage the SmartCart campaigns. It is a lot of labour, I guess in terms of downloading the results every day to sort of measure them, to track the spending and, make adjustments there. But that seems to have pretty good results at the moment. I think we're tracking at around 500% [ROAS] overall for our, for our return ad spend for our campaigns with, with the grocery fast moving consumer goods product. But that's sort of just how we do it and it's had good results in the past, so far. So that's to answer your question.

"Yeah, so 2 times I like to log in is either just after lunchtime. As sort of, the period when people are sort of, that's from our background and understanding that's sort of the two main times people are looking at it. So either sort of at lunchtime or just after lunchtime, there's a period of high shopping. But then also, if I don't get time to do it on that particular hour, then I'll move it back to around 4.30 [pm] around 5.00 [pm]. So then our spend correlates with people coming home and doing their shopping just when they get home as well. So they're sort of like the two key periods we've identified that people shop at and therefore timing it at those two times we have found also allows us to kind of try to correspond with those two peak shopping periods.",Buyer behaviour, Performance, Routine activity, AdManager,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"That's a little bit different to other platforms that might allow a daily spend because, putting in that daily spend at that time means that your budget might go quite early in the morning.

As well as if you kind of apply digital learning principles when people are sort of, looking for things to do. It's that period that last one before they get started sort of with their work and then sort of in the evening when they've come home and sort of sat down doing that stuff. So they're the two periods that we found. Again, there's never really been any problems in terms of budget pacing. Again, we're on very high level, sort of key search terms. So we're always going to be spending our budget, I guess it's just trying to be as efficient as possible with the budget. And that's why we've identified those two areas to be.",Budget, Buyer behaviour, Data, Insights, Pacing, Sales, Search terms / Keywords,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I don't look to create regular ones. At the moment. I think we've got about, if I was to have a guess, maybe 12 to 13 campaigns running at the moment. And they're ones that we've identified based on past learnings of what campaigns work well for us. Because our product range sort of fits very high-volume traffic searches, we don't really have a lot of budget to work with and go very long-tail down. Because again, with our products of say like So Good [product range], Weetbix cereal, Almond milk, Soy milk. That's sort of the basic, almost like some of your highest-level search terms on the page. They're the ones that we want to dominate in that regard.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So I think if we were to do say new products that identified with a very long sort of tail. Like, for example, I think the most recent one we put in was Oat milk. That was for our So Good oat product to sort of target that oat milk range. Again, we'd only necessarily look to start a campaign if we saw like a relevant search for that campaign, in particular. So we're not ones to sort of just have a campaign for every one of our products because simply we just don't have the budget to sort of spread that long-tail across the board. So we like to sort of capitalise on high-level search terms and then if we can identify a real longer-term, that's sort of gaining traction in that regard, we'd go down that road.",Business strategy, Campaigns, NPD (New Product Development), Relevancy, Search terms / Keywords,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Like, for example, we tried doing things like... we do have certain like cereal products, like protein cereal and kids cereal, but there just simply wasn't the search volume to split budget away from the high-level of cereal searches. And the fact that we can sort of arm up 8 products in that regard, anyway. People are going to be searching for cereal and seeing Weetbix. So we kind of take the same approach as if someone was shopping for cereal in the breakfast aisle. It's like our protein cereal is next to our Weetbix cereal. So we might as well have it in the cereal range rather than going quite low-level. Where that differs, I guess is in areas that design like a specific need. For example, gluten-free cereal. Like how gluten-free Weetbix works really well on that gluten free space and a high return Ad spend, as well as sort of quite high search volume traffic. So that's why we'll have sort of certain campaigns in that regard there.",Business decision, Business strategy, Campaigns, Categories, Search terms / Keywords,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"For me that's purely online. So again, we're quite a large company. So my budget given to me is a subset of say, like the online shopper budget, which is given then like from the in-store and online shopper budget. So there's, there's a few more managers above me that make those decisions and they, and it filters down to sort of this is your budget that you get. So yeah, I guess with e-commerce growing that number probably will increase as sort of the years go on and we see e-commerce gain a certain portion. But at the moment I operate, I'm not necessarily making decisions between in-store and online. I'm just making decisions based off what is given to me from a national sales manager perspective, in that regard.",Business decision, Business norm, eCommerce marketing/spend, Shopper marketing/spend, Budget, In-Store, Off-site, On-site,,,,,,,,,,,
"So it's sort of split off because again, we have many different sort of categories in those in those portions. We have to basically keep our wallets separate and based on what category they're targeting. Because from a sales manager perspective, we need to demonstrate that we're spending this much into this particular category. So we have two wallets at the moment. And the way I work out that split is that I'll name the campaigns based on what wallet and then what category that they're addressing. I then, when I'm downloading that information, I can sort of filter the campaigns based on what wallet they're addressing that way. And then sort of track the spending across each one. In terms of how I make a decision behind those campaigns, it sort of comes down to again, say all our campaigns for Breakfast cereal are equating to some tracking figure that we're keeping an eye on.",Business decision, Budget, Campaigns, Categories, Data, Filter, Metrics, Performance, Wallets, Excel,,,,,,,,,
"But the decisions on those campaigns is based on 'A' what the search volume is. And then I guess 'B' what the return on Ad spend [ROAS] and, and click through rate [CTR] is there. So for example, we're seeing that we're getting a great return on Ad spend for our category campaign. So I'll portion a bit more budget behind that one to sort of bring up that return ad spend. Because the return Ad spend that we're getting from our search term quality, it is not as great. There still needs to be a certain portion given to search terms, but I guess we kind of make decisions off what's giving us the best click through rate as well as what's giving us the best return and spend. So, I guess there's, there's campaigns within campaigns or campaigns within categories. There's a bit more flexibility in terms of where we put the money there. But they all ladder up [aggregate] to a certain portion that we need to spend behind that category. It's not like we can say, hey, almond milk performs better than breakfast cereal. Let's put more money behind almond milk because we need to, from a shopper perspective and a and a national account manager perspective, demonstrate that we're spending the money behind those categories.

So then, what I basically want to do again, [is look at] the top performing products. While it's sort of good to know on our end what the top performing products are, as I said, it's not like we can kind of make decisions between, you know, Weetbix is performing at the best return a spent at the moment. We need to move our almond milk products more behind SmartFoods Weetbix Breakfast. We can't do that because it's locked into a category spend.

"Because then that kind of lets me see. So now I know again what we sort of spent behind the entire campaign and then how we're tracking from a return Ad spent on that campaign and sort of track that span up and down based on my, based on my own learnings from that one there. So then I've just basically, judging not only the success of each individual campaigns, but then I guess the average campaign performance of all our breakfast cereal campaigns, from that regard there. So then I can see the conversion rate broken down so that I can [go] ok to improve this conversion rate, I need to maybe pull back on the breakfast cereal search wallet that we've got here.",Analysis, Campaigns, Conversion Rates, Data, Optimisation, Performance, Search terms / Keywords, Wallets, Hack or Workaround, Routine activity, Manual effort, Excel,,,,,,,
"So I make a decision around that. But again, and this is sort of, I guess where my own intuition sort of comes behind it. So we've got an increase of a budget of $105 a day. So then I've split it across. It means that we are increasing our cereals budget by [$]25 our breakfast cereal by [$]30 gluten-free by [$]15 cereal by [$]25 high five by [$]10. Because that can allow me to track the individual campaigns based on the overall increases that we need to make on a daily basis. And then, as you can see sort of the most money we're putting behind is our category of breakfast because we're getting almost double the return Ad spend [ROAS] that we see from the other search categories, in that category space. That sort of needs the most budget behind it.",Business decision, Budget, Categories, Optimisation, ROAS, Spend, Mental models,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But then I think there still needs to be a fairly even split behind search terms because that's an area that is searched a lot more. A lot of people do search in terms rather than by a category. So that still means budget to be covered sort of in that regard there. But I can see that there's probably an argument to increase our 'Cereals, Bites & Protein' [budget] because that's got a better click through rate [CTR] by far to about [$]35. And then bring that [Cereals] down to $15, maintain that [overall Breakfast Cereal category daily spend] $105 to improve our click through rate, because our breakfast cereal campaign that's targeting, say like our blends and that sort of stuff there does have quite a low click rate compared to our other products. And so I guess that's how I sort of make decisions on the performance of the overall wallet. It allows me to sort of track my budget from an overall wallet perspective and sort of keep the campaign separate as well as sort of see what adjustments we can make to an individual campaign level that has that flow-on effect to the overall category level.",Business decision, Budget, Categories, CTR (Click Thru Rate), Optimisation, Performance, Products, Search terms / Keywords, Mental models,,,,,,,,,,

If I go back into SmartCart’s and see. It doesn't sort of have that overview, that total amount that's broken down [in AdManager]. Like it hasm't actually shown that information there. So, I can see the individual campaigns and how they're going [in AdManager camapign dashboard], but in terms of tracking for the month, how is our breakfast cereal category going as a category and sort of what traction do we have from, I guess that overall, is the piece that's missing there.",Campaigns, Categories, Data, Performance, SmartCart, Hack or Workaround, Gap (Product or Service), Limitation, Excel,,,,,,,,,,

And that's why I've named the campaigns that you can see, that I've named them as such. So, this is pulling out [in the Excel spreadsheet] of our default wallet. This is pulling out of our non-dairy milk wallet and they're like grocery milk, any of the cereal or the grocery milk campaigns. They're different from our chilled milks that we've got here that are different from our frozen desserts in terms of vegan and the campaigns that we've got in that regard.

"Again, I might not just show you the other spreadsheet because it does lay out sort of our budget for the year and that sort of stuff. But essentially, I've got another spreadsheet that details sort of how our spend is going for how much we've got budgeted in the system. So say, for example, if we had say [$]3000 spend for our breakfast cereal campaign and we spent this time $2007.53 then I just work out, so we spent this, spent this, that's about 7 or 8 days left in the month eight. Essentially we've got $124 left that can be spread. So then I can put that in the budget in terms of how much we need to be spending a day to hit budget. And then that can be split off against each of the campaigns that we've got running in the system.",Budget, Campaigns, Optimisation, Performance, Spend, Limitation, Excel,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And then go through each of these campaign budgets, yeah.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So the daily spend is set on the campaign level on the campaign level. So it is then me going into each of the individual campaigns and increasing the budget incrementally by the number that I've got in here [in the Excel spreadsheet]. So the hope is and sort of how we track it and what we can see is that if I'm seeing, for example, if I had an example based on my findings of the total amount of the wallet. If we needed the wallet to go up 100 and $5 per day because we're not necessarily, to hit the full budget of the category of breakfast cereal. And we noticed, for example, oh, actually, you know what if we increase the high-fibre cereal breakfast that's there by $10 each day, it's not actually reaching that budget. Like, we can then see from that the cereal campaign [category] isn't spending $105 per day because it's not going up by that much. We're actually having to increase each time how much money we spend per day to hit that limit. So then we can go at this level and sort of see what campaign isn't necessarily pulling its weight from a budget perspective. And at this time, we can see that it's high-fibre cereal. So then I can look from a search term objective and go a bit deeper into, ok, high-fibre breakfast cereal isn't really being searched for that much. So therefore, while it even says $10 I might not put $10 behind it because I can see it's never sort of reached its budget of $30 sort of before. It's not sort of spending. Again, this is for the whole month. We can see that this month only spent a dollar 38 [$1.38] a dollar 83 [$1.83] even though we're increasing it by $10. So we might as well keep the budget at [$]30 because if someone searches for high-fibre breakfast here, we're going to be there. And that's checked out like, over the past 7 days, your impression share. And I know that's sort of an arbitrary figure, but we can kind of get a bit of an indication of whether we're coming up or not. So we are coming up for high-fibre. The answer to this question is people aren't just searching for high-fibre. So we might as well make that budget zero [changed Breakfast Cereal High Fibre campaign budget to 0.00 in Excel spreadsheet]. Still keep it at [$]30 [for the campaign budget] just to get any low-hanging fruit that gets searched there. But then let's turn up our either [Breakfast Cereal] category or 'Cereal, Bites & Protein' [campaign] to $45 or so by $10 [increase] there to get the [$]105 [overall category budget of all aggregated Breakfast Cereal campaigns]. So it is, I guess, applied at a campaign level rather than a category. But just the way that we were set up with the system, we have a deep wallet for cereal, we have a default wallet. We have a non-dairy milk wallet for our non-dairy milk campaigns. But I guess what is important from my perspective to show the NAM's [National Account Managers] is that we've spent this much money behind each category. Because they're the questions they get asked from that level. Like how much money you put behind, say chilled milk as opposed to grocery milk as opposed to frozen desserts. They [NAM's] have to hit certain quotas that I got to help them out with the system.

"I guess so, I guess from pacing, it's whether we're hitting our daily budgets that we're associating in there. And then I guess it becomes a question of, hey, what's our return on ad spend? What is the max CPC? So for example, with high-fibre cereal, someone might make the argument of, hey, say if our max bid was 50 cents and we can see that if not spending its daily budget from this regard. We might be like, well, is our max CPC not high enough? Is that what's happening here. Is this why this campaign isn't pacing. So this [Excel] sheet can then show me, well, look, every time we're sort of coming up here, we're paying 61 cents cost per click [CPC]. So it's not really a max CPC issue because we've got $3.10 there. We're sort of the, the main leader category in high-fibre cereal. So then it becomes oh, well, it's not necessarily being searched a lot and that sort of stuff. So I guess they're decisions that we make with pacing. To be quite honest with our products in particular, there's never really been a pacing issue because we've got such high volume and in a competitive space. So I guess then it becomes a matter of, is our max CPC sort of meeting what our cost per click is. Is it really close? Is it we're just not serving and then, are we hitting that total budget across the board there? And then that might be decisions based on, I guess the next step. What we've found from frozen desserts here is that, we've only got $22 increase per day. That's not a lot of budget in the frozen dessert space. We did have four campaigns operating. And it's like, oh, look, we're not really getting much of an impression share from that one. So, let's close the other three accounts. We make the most return ad spend and the best click through rate on this campaign. Let's just put the whole $22 behind this campaign rather than increasing it by $5.03 dollars.

I guess we do evaluate ROAS from a certain perspective, but we also judge the success of our campaigns by the click through and conversion rate that we're seeing. Because at the end of the day, we want to be relevant to the consumer, rather than total return on Ad spend. And I guess that comes with the decision of why we still keep certain campaigns, like say the breakfast cereal, cereal bites and protein campaign running, even though it's our worst return on Ad spend. Because people are still searching for cereal, we treat it as, you know, it's a place that we need to be in because that's how people search for it max.

And I always say that cautiously because I'm waiting for the day that other competitors jump on that category area. But as you can see especially with cereal, not so much with grocery milk because we do make certain strides in that area in grocery milk, we make our best return on ads spin, but especially in cereal we're getting some good return on Ad spend numbers there from being in that category space.",Brand marketing/spend, Business strategy, Concern or Worry, Categories, Competitor, ROAS, Search terms / Keywords, Spend, Positive feedback, Grocery,,,,,,,,,
"Well, I mean, it's a bit of both. So, I mean I do look at that daily spend. I'm still logging in maybe not every day because it's not a requirement to log in every day. It would certainly help from a weekend perspective because at the moment, as you can see there, I'm logging in on say Thursday, Friday, increasing the budget by three to account for those three days. So to have that sort of taken care of would be, would be fantastic. I mean, I'd still love to log into it. This is sort of my... I like work with numbers and stats. So I do like the fact that I can log in every day and sort of download the campaign and see how they're working. I would say I'd still have the hands-on approach in terms of making decisions. But a lot of the grunt work of just logging in, like, you know, as part of the grunt work is just logging into each campaign, bringing up each of these campaigns and getting the calculator out to increase each one by that amount, right? So, if that's handled it sort of on a daily basis, I guess a lot more of it could be spent digging into not only the campaigns, but also a lot of time is me digging into the search terms and what search terms are driving this and then what, what products are driving this. So again, I guess if that grunt work of that daily login increase, that download of the information, is automated then I guess a lot more decisions can be made around, say the search terms and tweaking those and doing that sort of stuff. Rather than sort of just increasing the budget on a daily basis. There still is that tweaking, but I guess when I say grunt work I'm talking about just logging in there downloading and updating the numbers to make sure they account correctly. Because you'll still need to do that as I said, I wouldn't necessarily take like a 'set and forget' approach because there might be things you need to jump on. So for example, like that high-fibre cereal, if I'm banking on that campaign to spend $10 a day. Again this is a very small example, but if I needed a campaign to spend $1000 a day, I would still be wanting to log in and sort of check that to make sure that it was doing that. Or if we suddenly had a competitor who jumped on and then ramped up the category campaign $2 cost per click, then I'd still be wanting to log in every second day or third day to check and see if there's anything like that that's happening. Because it's a very, I guess dynamic system and sort of one change by a competitor can have a ripple effect across everybody. So it's still, I guess, important to be logging in even if a lot of the grunt work is being taken care of to kind of jump in and make those adjustments.",Business decision, Concern or Worry, Budget, Campaigns, Competitor, Data, Metrics, Optimisation, Performance, Search terms / Keywords, Spend Limits / Cap-outs, Hack or Workaround, Routine activity, Manual effort, Excel,,,,
"So, I guess if we're looking at daily budget spends, it'd be [Google] Ad words and Facebook sort of having that capability. I also do the bidding across the AdManager platform, which is the Coles-facing platform that does allow the daily spend as well to be associated there. I guess they're the other platforms that I mean, at the end of the day, sort of with that daily spend capability. But again, in terms of downloading the report across AdManager, it's still the same, you still need to get rid of that, the 'K' [thousands indicator] build it out, download that information because it doesn't allow that sort of summary at the top in terms of those campaigns there. But the one difference sort of between the two systems is that daily spend compared to the only aspects we have is an Always On campaign or a total spend. And we've stayed away from the Always On because there's no real... apart from the wallet, I guess it becomes there where the lock comes on in terms of that control of Always On.",Budget, Data, Performance, Spend, Spend Limits / Cap-outs, Wallets, Coles, Manual effort, AdManager, Excel,,,,,,,,,

"So if I'm looking at say grocery milk. Again, we keep our products pretty small, tight in the grocery milk space. So we did have our hero products. So we did have our grocery milk products appearing there. We normally have, say like an almond [milk]. We did have just say like two products in there at that space. We have adjusted that now to... sorry, I'm getting a lot of notifications coming up. We adjusted it to sort of loading up the priority SKU’s as much as possible. So at the moment we've got about, but our three hero products, if you will, some of the Almond milk, the Original and Barista Almond milk. There's not many adjustments we have here because we have little products sort of within this campaign. So like we've got 20 products in there. We're making calls in or out with those 20 or so products.

"On a monthly basis, I sort of download the product information seeing which ones are giving us our best return a spend. I guess you can see [in the Campaign Dashboard in AdManager] the barista milk is being shown the most and it has the best return on Ad spend that we've got here. But we actually do see that our unsweetened almond milk is the one that's the most clicked on. So I just look at this information in terms of just getting a general gist of what our products are doing within the system. But we know from sales market that our almond unsweetened, is sort of our hero seller. It's great to have the Barista milk in there because it's quite a good buy. It's also great to see based on this information that our products are basically bought. I mean, in this case, it's bought four times. So for every one sort of conversion, we're getting four sales in almost in this regard. And you can see with this one here too [So Good Unsweetened Almond Milk], 437 conversion that's resulted in 1137 sales. So I guess if we're looking at things that could be added here, it'd kind of be cool to maybe see like an average basket frequency. I know that I sort of do a bit of an estimation of the sales divided by the conversions to just sort of see, hey, people are buying a product on average by three in terms of how everyone purchase equates to three products being sold.

But as you can pretty much see with this one [in the Campaign Dashboard in AdManager]and this is from, I guess past history data that I've sort of culled as we've gone through. So there's only two search terms in this regard. But I would make the decision that, you know, we also had say 'almonds', we also had 'milk for almonds', like other search terms in there. And then just based on the click through rate [CTR] and the conversion rate and the amount of impressions, it's making sure that, you know, what are we seeing from an impression and return on Ad spend level here? And again, this is not hardcore [UI] changes. This is just for my own benefit and quick understanding. So, you know, there's no way we can...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yeah. And I think that's just purely because of the types of industries that we're in. I mean, almond milk and this is data that we've had downloaded from Woolworths and provided by Woolworths and that sort of stuff just to see, what is the volume. And it's also a strategy. So for example, for cereal, we know Weetbix is searched a lot, and we would have a great return on Ad spend with our SmartCart if we target Weetbix as a search term. But that's not the strategy with our cereal products because we want to be in spaces where people are making the decision, rather than sort of running sponsored Ads on Weetbix when they already decided to buy a Weetbix products. So that's why in this sort of one we know that So Good [products] might work. But we know that almond milk just has the volume to support our spend in the campaign. And it also has a quite a good conversion rate and click through rate too. So they're sort of the decisions that we make around say almond milk. If we were to do a new campaign, we would essentially start broad and then work our way in, as we saw. So we've had this campaign running for quite a long time now and we found that it's best to just appear on that almond milk search term for this individual campaign.

"Yeah. So I guess we do it by, first when we put in a campaign, I'll do some research organically. So what products are appearing, what products are high? What products do we need to sort of implement in this area? So, for example, with our serial campaign, we saw that Weetbix Organic is coming up quite high on that page. Sorry, not organic, the Weetbix value pack. So the 1.2 kg value pack is coming up quite high organically anyway. So that product doesn't really, we need to be in our campaign because we want to bring up our lower-tail products in there because if someone sees Weetbix 1.2 kg on the same page on special or something like that, they'll be buying it from organically or that's what we hope, in that regard there. And then I guess it's also a bit of a decision with the sales managers that we have on our ends in terms of, hey, what products are you guys wanting to hero?

Like you go, how can we get it says we've got, I don't know, say 5000 out of 20,000 [25% share of voice].

So that's still something that I think, I mean, if it was in the platform and easy to use and you could do it all in the platform, you know?

"So it might also be worth looping in, if we set up a separate call, I can loop in our head of product. Now our GM of product, she got a title change but she deals with OMG as a whole and all the teams that work across the eCommerce platform. So definitely be good to get her on.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"One other just slight feedback while I thought about it. It would be great for my reporting and I'm sure you got this feedback already, but to be able to pull a longer time period or a custom time period and then either break it down by like a day or a week or a month.

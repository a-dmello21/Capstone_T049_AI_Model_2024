"I'm going to share my screen but I'm actually going to have Tammy walk through the presales process first, right? Ok. Can you see my screen? OK, Tammy do you want to go into what you do in SalesForce and how you kind of lock a deal?",SalesForce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thanks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yeah, so you click into the opportunity section. We would do - and Katy doesn't want to give access - but there's a way that you can do like a new deal, typically. Do you want me to share my screen?",Managed service, SalesForce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yeah. Can you do the SalesForce? And I'll start.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Let me see.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ok, so you would jump into opportunities [in SalesForce].",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Let's say you had a conversation with the CPG and you're ready typically on outreach, we would set up like a new opportunity. So depending on the retailer that you're on, you're going to have a consistent format that you would put your opportunity name is. It's really tied into like it's helpful for billing stuff and Katy I don't think the opportunity name has too much to do with set up. [Katy responded 'No']",CPG (Consumer Packaged Goods), Billing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And then we have the account name. So if the account is not set up, there is some stuff that we need to go through to get the account set up from like an approval from like a finance perspective. So assuming the account set up, we would put that in.",Approvals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If they are working with an agency, we put that in.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The [opportunity] stage names are typically like 'open' is going to be your first reach out. If you get a response and you're in 'negotiating' or 'pitching' stages with the client, you would adjust these [in the dropdown menu]. And that really just weights it out in terms of like how much we feel like the deal is going to close. So the closer that you get to locked, the higher percentage of actually locking [the deal] is. 'Pending', once we've set the IO out and we're waiting for signature and then once it's locked, I can kind of walk you through the steps that would happen in a deal once it's locked. You'd plug in your start and end date - these would feed directly into PIO [Placements IO]. So this would be things that need to match the IO. They would also need to match in PIO, which is what Ali's team uses as well.",Insertion Order (IO), Placements IO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The amount [input field] this is going to tie, this is the total amount on the IO. A lot of times we'll have multiple line items on the IO. So like that's when you would submit a media plan and that would feed into PIO. And CSM's and Ad Op's would utilise the PIO line items. But this would be the total amount on the IO.",Placements IO, Insertion Order (IO), Managed service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Sorry Tammy, the CSM would work with the sales person based on the budget that Tammy has in here in the line is she's thinking of and create the media plan in PIO to then come back to Tammy.",Planning, Managed service, Placements IO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So 'Bill to Account' [field], this obviously is all billing related but it, if it's either agency or account, so you'd put plug that in there.",Billing, Agencies, Brands, Business norm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"These are, so this would be I'd be the owner. We'd have a CSM. This would all tie into PIO, we'd have the close date. So the date that you locked it or your expected date that you're going to lock it - manage or self-serve [selection from the managed vs Self Serve dropdown]. So this is a signal to Op's if they're managing it or not.",Self-serve, Managed service, Placements IO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We'll put in here if there is an integrator. Typically we have that information from the account when we're setting it up. And then lead type is just how we got the lead.,Business norm, Managed service, Partners,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We plug in one billing contact, we can't lock it without a billing contact. Obviously super important to ensure that we can bill the clients. Mine is a little bit different because I have ABSCO, but these are just ABSCO fields, but I'll relate back to billing.",Billing, Absco (Albertsons Media Collective),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So, let's just go into a Pepsi deal [in SalesForce].",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So let's say that I had just locked, or I guess let’s say it went into pending stage that what Katy is talking about, is like when I would go in and put the media plan in. So let me click on media plan.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yeah, this is going to open PIO. I always get an error every time I open it, so I open it twice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But it always works the second time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ali, this is more or less what my team is doing. So I don't know all of the details, but they would go and submit a request.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So they go in and then yeah, they create the line items there.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Tammy doesn't have the plus button [in Placements Io] - there's a plus button on the side - and based on what Tammy has in her media brief after speaking with the client and what they want to see. If it's just SPA [Sponsored Product Ads] they'll just do one line item. But they may want it broken by sub-brand or need to be billed by sub-brand. So we would build additional line items under here and that is a signal to operations that different wallets are needed to be created. Because we have to keep budgets separated so we don't over bill each particular one. If there's a different media mix, so if they want off-site, social or banners as well as SPA, that would all be a line item under there, but could be a singular wallet. So that's something that Tammy would have to give to us in notes or the CSM would give to us in notes when we're thinking about a setup.",SPA (Sponsored Product Ads), Placements IO, Managed service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And then based on which retailer, we have a breakdown of percentages in which we put towards banners and SPA and social. We always try and start with the most money in on-site SPA and then use the remaining funds into the other formats.",Planning, SPA (Sponsored Product Ads),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So once the CSM builds this, it can be exported into an IO and contract. And then that is placed back into the SalesForce line item here for Tammy to export and send over to the client for signature.",SalesForce, Placements IO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So then once we get the IO for signature, I would move it to this locked stage [in SalesForce]. And we use this chatter function to communicate back and forth between CSM and sales.",Insertion Order (IO), Contracts, SalesForce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So there's a few different ways that we would go about it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Some of it is organic. Like they'll reach out to us or the retailer would send it over to us. A lot of times the team is strategising in terms of like who they want to reach out to. And they're either getting contacts from other people that are working with that client within AdManager. Or we're using things like Winmo or LinkedIn to try and find contacts. But the times where we're like reaching out strategically, it's typically all tied back to keyword rev [revenue] opportunity on search. So like eggs consistently as an opportunity. So we're always like on Albertson's we'd be taking a look at like, OK, looking at their product assortment. Like who are the brands that we don't have playing [spending] in eggs right now? And we'd be reaching out to them to get them to start spending.",Winmo, AdManager, Brands, Revenue, Search terms / Keywords, Albertsons, Retailers, Business strategy,,,,,,,,,,
Yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yeah. So, I guess I kind of skipped over that part [the media plan]. So once we get the locked. Like it's locked and we have the IO signed and let's say it's for mainland service. It's kind of, there are a few different processes I would say across retailer. But obviously, we need to get the information over to Op's in terms of like what SKU's that they're going to be putting into the campaigns and then also the strategy against it. So we have a managed service strategy doc. I can see if I can pull one [Excel spreadsheet in SharePoint] up for you guys to see. This is for Albertson's, but I know that a few other retailers have similar ones out there that they're utilising.",Planning, Excel, Insertion Order (IO), Managed service, Albertsons, SKU, SharePoint, Retailers,,,,,,,,,,
"Yeah, there's always going to be some sort of brief. So we understand the client objectives before we set up and know how to optimise in the future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Correct. Yeah, for a contract. But then I Tammy will also have this conversation with them simultaneously.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yeah. So once we lock it in, we'll go through like basically before the IO start date would be. We like to get it signed, but then we'll walk through this with them. But it basically ensures that they're aligned on executing all of the placements. There are some, obviously things that we need to know about each placement. So home page carousel, so we can only have two products [placement slots]. So like we align with them on what those two products are. So that it's very clear for Ad Op's as they're setting up campaigns. A few other questions are just like things that we ensure that the supplier knows about each placement. We'll have the BPN list, which is essentially the SKU list. BPN is just what Albertsons calls it. And then we have a keyword list. So basically, it's going to give the product and the BPN or SKU and the keywords that tie back to each of those products. So we have, in Pepsi's case, we had, I want to say like 60 just for FNLA, which is just our snacks like different lines because we had to set up multiple campaigns because of ensuring that like relevant products and keywords were just in one campaign. And then we'll do the same thing for branded. We'll break out all of the branded keywords.",Search terms / Keywords, Placements, Managed service, Relevancy, Products, Albertsons, Pepsico, Insertion Order (IO),,,,,,,,,,
From an API perspective this is something that's a pain point is Albertson's uses a BPN and Target uses a TSIN and some people use a SKU and some people use a product code. So we would never be able to set up like one campaign across multiple retailers as it stands today.,API, Data challenge, SKU, UPC or Identifier, Albertsons,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Some sort of standardised. Because even UPC's differ a little bit.,UPC or Identifier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And would also allow us the ability to look at like, ok, why aren't some, like, ok, Pepsi is performing better on Target. There could be opportunity on this other retailer. Ok. Well, they're missing 20 UPC'S. Let me go see if I can convince them to add those UPC's. Or like, how do I like just another way that we can figure out how to get more money across retailer.",Pepsico, Target, Retailers, UPC or Identifier, Future opportunity,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have a million things open.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I think that like that Katy unless there's other things I can, you know.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"No, I think that ends the sales portion. So I'll switch to where I pick up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So once we get into Placements [Placements IO], we have a workflow in place to make sure that the contract is within a certain start date. The line items in here match SalesForce and the contract again. So we just do checks and balances before things can officially go live. So this is workflow for  4 of 4 [4th step in the workflow in Placements IO]. So if it falls within a five day, that has to be approved by an Ad operations lead to make sure that it can fit into our workflow. Obviously, this time of year, most things are coming in last minute as people are trying to spend their budgets [i.e. end of year budgets], so that has to be approved. And then the ready for trafficking is the last stage. So we'll double check the IO the line items are good to go. The team name is filled out and that the Ad server is equal to CUI [AdManager UI] so that it connects to our API from there.",SalesForce, Placements IO, Approvals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Once it's live, the CSM can talk to us, and this is something that's going to be changing next year. But they will then come to Service Now and submit a trafficking ticket to our team. So they'll create a campaign and then all of the information that we need and is applicable to our setup from the CSM will come in here [New Campaign creation in SalesForce]. So they can type in the retailer, start and end date, they can send it to the correct team, what the deal name is, who the supplier account is.",Managed service, SalesForce, Campaigns, Date or Time related,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I'm going to use one that's in test right now, so I don't alert people. What the deal name is. The budget, any applicable information that we need to know here. They'll put in their asset folder link. So that includes the brief that Tammy has. For others that would include the SL template, which is just a different way to do the brief. But just so you guys are aware, this is one single campaign [displayed a large campaign list in SalesForce]. But because how Kraft breaks down their wallets. We have to have keywords by product by template so that we can set it up in the platform. So someone like Kraft could equal, I don't know Tammy, like what 1000-line items in the platform just from search. That's not any other placement that we have on our site just because it's not smart enough to put SKU's with keywords at this point.",Products, SalesForce, Search terms / Keywords,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So once they submit all of this information, this is where the CSM and Ad Op's team will speak back and forth. And then we'll have our queue [campaign list] in here to go through now.",Managed service, Routine activity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yeah, we have to think of every search term imaginable to every product SKU. But we also from a search perspective, don't want their site to appear broken. So we don't want milk to show up on Oreos or cheddar cheese to show up when someone is searching Swiss. Because it is such an intentional part of a shopping trip we want to make sure that it looks correct when we're serving an Ad. And if it's the correct ad, it's going to get clicked more and then obviously drive more revenue. But we have to manually put all of that together.",SKU, Search terms / Keywords, Products, Manual effort, Ad serving,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And it's feedback too from like Alberton, right, Tammy where they were really challenging us on the long-tail like OK, maybe if we just did the keyword cheese. Like we wouldn't have to create so many. But it's not just cheese, it's Swiss cheese, six packs, it's cheddar cheese, you know, lump cheese.",Albertsons, Search terms / Keywords, Business challenge,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yeah, something like a smart phrase match. If we had a dedicated analytics person to thinking of different keywords, even misspellings like coffee with a single 'f' is actually searched more than coffee spelled however you spell coffee. But a single 'e' [for coffee] is actually searched more than the correct way to spell coffee. [Limitation]",Search terms / Keywords, Limitation, Guidance, Future opportunity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But those are things that we have to learn and we see none of that in the platform at this point. So that's another platform that we have to go into and has to be maintained and specialised in DataGrid in terms of Ad calls and things like that. So Tammy and her team have gotten really good at like diving down and having a good relationship with the retailer. So even beyond what we can see, Tammy is working with Albertsons to understand what their top search terms are on the retailer. Which we at this point don't really have insight to unless we tie something to it and deliver an Ad.",Business challenge, DataGrid,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I think that's a really important point Katy and something you know, I know our, our strategy is increasingly leaning into API S but I don't think an API partners, they don't have this solved either. Right. And it's something that we have to figure out on our end.",API, Business strategy, Partners, Business challenge,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And then just a side note too, since we're on the topic. But like the suggested search terms, which is something we've, you know, we actually are doing with Albertsons. We've also seen a lot of issues with it in terms of, if they don't have everything mapped accurately and you as a user go in and add the suggested search term and it's not mapped to all the products, it could actually missfire against some certain products. And we've had that actually cause a mix of under deliveries. [Limitation]",Limitation, Errors or Issues, Search terms / Keywords, Albertsons, Data challenge, Products,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So I don't know if we went that route and continued with how we're doing the suggested search terms, but we built it, I still feel like there are some bugs that would need to be fixed. And that just because it's not like bulletproof.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ok. So once we have all this submitted, that's where our team will then come in and create either in the platform [AdManager]. So from here, we'll know whether the retailer or the brand team exists or if it's a net new retailer, we'll create a new team. For some of the slower platforms like Target the team actually traffics directly through the Pacvue interface. Just so because they can do things three times as fast as that Target UI [AdManager instance].",Pacvue, Retailers, Target, AdManager,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But then our team will come in here, they'll create the wallets that are necessary. Again, cross checking the IO and you'll see that we can have hundreds of thousands of wallets. So this is Kraft every quarter, they break it out. We have to create a new wallet. We then have to either duplicate the campaigns and tie it to the new wallets because we lose historical data if we don't. [Limitation]",Limitation, Kraft (Heinz/Kraft), Insertion Order (IO),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So that also then slows teams down because then we have 4000 campaigns by Q4 [forth quarter] within that team.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We then have to individually invite all of our offshore team members, all of our onshore team members, the API partners. So Pacvue, if they're going to use them, we have a user name for them. And then also the brand itself as a supplier view [in AdManager]. So this has 105 people and because we have no bulk way of doing that, it is an offshore person single-handedly going through from a spreadsheet of a roster and one-by-one entering the appropriate user name. [Limitation]",Bulk actions, Limitation, AdManager, Pacvue, Excel, API,,,,,,,,,,,,
"From an Ad Op's perspective, it also slows down our UI's. So, I know that's a open problem statement because we have to be in every single team self-serve and manage service from a sales lead perspective. Tammy needs to be able to see every team and detail so that we can provide the optimisations and suggestions to them. Otherwise, we have no insight into how things are performing.",UI, Managed service, Poor experience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Once trafficked, we'll confirm it back. Placements [IO] will then start syncing and seeing data from the platform and showing delivery OI, so where we are per line item in the platform. So we have specific naming conventions as you can see on our wallets. This is the Placements [IO] ID, contract ID and then the last number there is the line item ID in Placements [IO]. So those are the two things that Katie [McNinney] has built into DataGrid and into our API connection with placements to be able to appropriately tie line items back to contracts.",DataGrid, Placements, AdManager, Contracts, Placements IO, API,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And then to the wallet and to the line items in the platform. So if I go into Kraft [in AdManager], even our campaign names include all of that. So that the different campaigns tied to the appropriate wallets and tied to the appropriate contract, which ties to the appropriate Placements [IO] line item, which ties to the appropriate SalesForce contract.",Kraft (Heinz/Kraft), Wallets, Contracts, Placements IO, AdManager, Campaigns, SalesForce,,,,,,,,,,,
"Additionally, if we have off-site as well, they're using a similar naming convention so that we can do a hack for Unified Reporting. And they can see if we have that. And then if they're utilising off-site as well, there will be an advanced reporting button here [at top of Campaign Manager screen in AdManager] that they can kick out and see the appropriate campaigns.

"Once it is live, we then don't really do anything in the platform.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Until we go to one of these several dashboards here in DataGrid. So we have zero concept or understanding of how a campaign is pacing until we come into the dashboard [Pacing Dashboard in DataGrid].,DataGrid, Pacing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So this is what our pacing dashboard looks like.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"You can choose a retailer from there [in DataGrid], it'll filter down to the appropriate trafficker which is defined at the placements level. I can also look at a specific seller. So Tammy can come in here and just choose her campaigns or I can choose a specific CSM. I can then see the different levels that we have. So managed is our team is handling it. Self-serve means that they are 100% doing it themselves. And guided self-serve is someone like a Publicis agency who is spending a million dollars but want to run it themselves, their agency, but we will give them additional service of optimisations how to use the platform, walk throughs, things like that just because of their level of spend.",Publicis, Agencies, Campaigns, Managed service, Optimisation, DataGrid, Spend, Retailers, Placements, Self-serve,,,,,,,,
We have an indication here of when the data was last updated. So we're pretty much stuck if this doesn't update.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We have really no concept especially in Q4 of how things are going.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And then there's different levels here. So we can see the pipeline, what the opportunity name is from SalesForce, what the line item name is from Placements [IO], what a wallet count is. So if it's Grocery One and we have the multiple UI's of grocery, Hy-Vee and you know, we're going to have Freshops soon. We can see that it's running across all three UI's. That's the indication to us. This is how we determine if there's a problem. So last day of impressions, if it's not yesterday, then something's wrong. If it should be live and delivering, last day of spends, line item start date, line item end date from PIO line item booked from PIO, the remaining wallet balance from the platform. How much of it is completed [in Completed column in DataGrid]. What we should be at in order to deliver in full [in % Needed to be Completed column in DataGrid]. And then that's just the dollar amount. Where we should have spent. Our estimated total delivery based on the last 7 day’s worth of data. So this is constantly changing. If we get it into a better spot, that'll obviously go down. And then this [Estimated Under Delivery column] helps to determine our estimated over and under delivery. These two are again, only off the last 7 days’ worth of data. And then the average daily spend. Average 7 day daily spend. So here I can see that, you know, we've made some changes, and we need to figure that out. And then the average daily spend we need to hit in order to complete the contract in full by the end date. And then it just pulls in some high-level metrics here [e.g. Impressions, Clicks, ROAS and Conversions].",UI, ROAS, Grocery, Placements IO, Manual effort, Conversion Rates, Grocery Network / Grocery One, Spend, SalesForce, Business challenge, Metrics, Impressions,,,,,,
"And also we can see again, then who the owner of the CSM, the trafficker, what the service type is, the account. And then these are the line item media plan ID's for us to traffic off of.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We also have a media plan dashboard [in DataGrid] which is the quick view for us to see, so we don't have to go into SalesForce, into Placements [IO] and into the contract, how things are set up. So this is all pulling directly in and we can see all of the line item start dates, how it's going to be billed. So if we have a FTA line item, we can see that it's going to be fixed. If it's a banner that's running on a CPM [Cost Per Mille, thousand], we can see that. And then also if it's going to be CPC, so search, we can see that. Down here [in Transaction History] we can also see when wallets were topped up. If there's any sort of discrepancy.

OK. So we would export that. I would then filter it [in DataGrid] - I think I have one open that I can show you - by largest underdelivery. And that's how the team determines through the platform which they need to focus on.,DataGrid, Managed service, Performance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We would come in here [Campaign Manager in AdManager]. Where we're lacking right now is our understanding of where the bid is at winning. No one knows that. So it's a guess in the dark of where that is. And if we do see that it's based in the last 30 days’ worth of data, but people are changing bids every hour of every day.

"We also then would look here [at campaign line items and Search terms in AdManager] and I know I've been begging for this, but I don't understand which SKU's are performing good against which search terms.

I would search my search terms, see if we're even showing up on the [SPA search results] grid and then try and force it through.

I can call this [Mac & Cheese campaign] a dinner, an easy snack, a microwave meal, things like that.

"Yeah. So we've taken, I mean, I created a report that basically pulls in Ad requests that we've gotten from Albertson's and it covers off on 85% of the Ad requests. And it's a little over 8000 keywords. And we've manually mapped those all to categories. So we basically have a report that takes those keywords with the categories. And then it does a look up based off of, let's say we were looking at digging into this Kraft campaign. It would say it would do a 'V' look up to say like, hey, is this? It'll say yes if it's in the campaign or not. And then I'd be like, OK, well, I'm in [the campaign]. I'd go to like the lowest category possible. So if I was in like, if there was a 'Mac and Cheese' category, I don't think there is, it's called like a noodles category. I'd filter them on noodles and then I would see like, OK, instead of Katy trying to shoot in the dark, I would at least have what is actually being searched on Albertson's website. And then potentially see what's, what's like able to be added to the campaign. But again, just like Katy was saying, it is an extremely manual process, but it is really the only way that we can get additional keywords added.

But then when you get on someone like a homepage or a past purchase or a PDP [spend strategy], those gain a lot of impressions and generally a lot of clicks, but they're harder to convert on. So they'll spend majority of the money. So when we think of a setup strategy, we'll always run keyword uncapped at the line item level and then start with a percentage cap towards the other placements.",Managed service, Budget, Bench-marking, Campaigns, AdManager, ROAS,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But then we also, to not potentially blow through the entire budget, we have wallet caps on every single wallet.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"That's also super manual to manage [wallets] because we have no concept of the budget in there or the start and end date. So yes, it does stop if we go over one day. But we do have to go in there quite a bit and make changes. And then specifically for heavy up-periods, our team has to manually go through every single wallet and change the dollar amounts to ensure we spend more and then pull it back because if we can't secure incremental dollars, we have to run the campaign throughout the duration of the contract. So we do definitely think about performance when making optimisations. [Limitation] [Manual effort]",Manual effort, Limitation, Wallets, Spend Limits / Cap-outs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I think that also comes into, Katy when you're talking about like performance on keywords and products against those like being able to see that type of reporting. Because sometimes it might be pulling out a product against a keyword. If it is like a keyword like cheese or milk, maybe you have better performing products against those keywords that are very highly sought after and have high CPC’s that you want to be a bit more strategic. And then you can have maybe all of your other products be bidding on all the other-mid to long-tail [keywords]. So you are still getting visibility to all products, but maybe you are a little bit more strategic. But not having visibility to how products are performing against keywords, makes it difficult to look at that. Like we have to pull one off reporting for it. [Limitation]",Limitation, Performance, Reporting, Products, Gap (Product or Service),,,,,,,,,,,,,
And I would say that's where our bid by keyword is lacking a little bit. Like we do have to manually put that in. But there's also no concept of SKU mapping towards those keywords. So we still have to create another group to separate those out and bid strategy different against those keywords and product groupings. [Limitation] [Manual effort],Manual effort, Limitation, Bidding, Optimisation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If we're managing it, we can come up with how the SKU mapping should go.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But it does need to make sense for how the search grid appears on the site. So like we can't use like I said earlier, milk against Oreos unless we have specifically the cross-sell placement set up on the site. So the terms must fit into the appropriate category in order to deliver.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yeah, we do all the approving and things like that on our end if it's managed service and even are the ones who are making the decision for self-serve campaigns that come through.",Approvals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The only category that Albertson's is a little bit weary about is 'fresh' [produce] category.,Albertsons, Categories,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So like, like strawberry, they wouldn't want strawberry milk or strawberry popsicles. Like they've loosened it a little bit. Like they were very much like any fresh terms, actually, the consumers looking for fresh products. So that's what we want to feed. We did see a drop in business when we did that. So they loosened it up a little bit more.",Albertsons, Categories, Buyer behaviour,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But I don't know if any other retailers Katy have those type of restrictions, but that would be the only thing we run into.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yeah, Target will sometimes reach out to us and say, hey, we don't love this. So can you reject the campaign?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But one thing about our rejection is it doesn't actually stop the campaign. It still does the previous version. So we have to reach out to a self-serve person, tell them they must remove it and resubmit the campaign. But if we reject something, it should stop the entire campaign, not do the previous version. [Limitation] [Manual effort]",Approvals, Limitation, Manual effort,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Through Pacvue and on Target, we use their bid optimisation tools [e.g. Optimisation Rules in Pacvue]. And this is particularly useful for first-price auctions or our discount scheme, auction type. Just because we have to touch those a lot more and manually go in and go up and down on the bids versus the second-price auction where we can set the max and the platform does that bidding for us.",Pacvue, Competitor advantage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So this is what that looks like.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We had come in here [in Pacvue] and create rules.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Let me see. Here's one, send it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We can set up the dates we want it to run [by editing Rule in Pacvue]. Send an email to the Op's team or whoever you would like. Every time it needs to run a rule. We apply at the wallet level or in here. It's called a campaign tag. And then it'll ask us what we would like to run that rule off of. So this one is if you know it clicks go over this increase the bid by 6% but we have a cap of $4.50. It's going to look to run this rule every three days and exclude - this is just a limitation from Pacvue - the last 2 days’ worth of data. Oh, sorry. It looks at the last three days excluding less. So it's doing the third day and then it's running every two days at 11 a.m. if the rule applies to those particular campaigns. One thing with this though, and I know Henri has submitted a ticket that if you run this rule through here [Optimisation Rule in Pacvue], but you have utilised the bid by keyword [in AdManager], it only updates the singular top bid, not the keywords below it. And then you cannot adjust the keywords any further from - I'm trying to find one so I can show you - you can no longer update the bid from this section [Quick edit popup against a campaign in AdManager]. You have to go to the campaign report, go in individually all the way back through the workflow and apply the bids to every single term. So that's a miss on our API. And I imagine we're losing money off of it because if someone wants to increase their bid, it's not applying it to every keyword. So it's not actually increasing bids. [Limitation] [Manual effort]",Limitation, AdManager, Pacvue, Manual effort, Competitor advantage,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So just something to look out there. Also in Pacvue - so we use that a lot - we can also day-part in Pacvue. So we have a particular brand Waterloo who only wants to run their Seltzer campaign on goPuff between the hours of 3 p.m. and midnight because that's when the traffic is at the highest peak on goPuff and they don't have an unlimited budget. So we can set up things like that.,Pacvue, goPuff, Budget, Day-parting, Competitor advantage,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We also can use this to do 'heavy up' [increase in shopper traffic] on it. So over like Cyber weekend and Cyber Monday, we could come up in here [in Pacvue] and say spend 50% more of the daily budget that we have allocated for those three days. And then reduce it back down, that time. So we don't have to do it individually. We just set up a rule [Optimisation Rule in Pacvue], apply it to all the appropriate wallets and send it out into our ether, and it makes that adjustment for us when filling wallets.",Pacvue, Competitor advantage, Optimisation, Wallets,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Budget Manager [in Pacvue], I can do a bulk. So we use this for bulk operations now as well. So if we need to pause or do that so that you don't have to go through this Ahold campaign [in AdManager] and individually archive every single one that is needed. And as you can see, there's hundreds of lines [campaigns in AdManager] and that takes our offshore team quite some time to have to execute.",Pacvue, Competitor advantage, Campaigns, AdManager, Bulk actions,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yeah. We can also archive and then reactivate and then also through here [Budget Manager in Pacvue], if an end date needs to be extended, we can just do it in here as well. And then that pushes out to the [AdManager] UI instead of having to do that individually again.",Pacvue, Date or Time related, Competitor advantage, AdManager,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Back to thinking about optimisations. There's some other tools that we have built here [in DataGrid] that the platform is really lacking as our API partners have no insight to. So we do have to run things on caps to ensure that it lasts. But unless you pulled by day and there was a single wallet you couldn't understand at what point per day that particular campaign was going dark [not serving]. So this has been built [Wallet Cap Out dashboard in DataGrid]. It tells us how many hours per day it's live, what percentage of a current day it's live. If there's a budget, a daily budget on the line item, it'll give you that. And then it will tell us what the recommended budget is based on the average number of hours dark [not serving]. And then this is done at both the campaign level, but also the wallet level.",Optimisation, DataGrid, Publishers, Managed service, Spend Limits / Cap-outs, API, Budget,,,,,,,,,,,
"So we only typically run campaigns on a wallet level versus the line item level. So it's one for self-serve, one for wallet level cap outs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If we're utilizing someone. Sorry, Dieter, sorry.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Out of funds, and then what should Tammy pitch back to them [brands] based on what they're missing?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"With that, it also gives us like forecasted ROAS if they were to spend more. The important part is that we have the additional data points [in Campaign Cap out report in DataGrid] to sell that story back to them [brands] in order to take on additional money. They're not just going to give us more money if it's not going to perform well and they're not going to get additional sales. So this is a little cheat for Tori.",Forecasting, ROAS, DataGrid, Data, Reporting, Brands,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It's not 100% exact I imagine Tori, you have other things that you do when you go back to them. So maybe you go into that for Dieter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yeah. So it's pretty elementary in terms of the calculation. But basically, it's just looking at, what their average hourly spend was up until the time they capped out and assuming that they'd spend that same amount throughout the rest of the day. So obviously, we know that people [buyers] continue like clicks and Ad requests continue to rise throughout the day and then we peak and then we drop off. So something like that's capping out at 8 a.m. we're probably likely going to underestimate how much incremental we could truly spend. So if I were going out to a client, I'd maybe bump it up slightly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And then for the same situation, if it was capping out at 11 p.m. at night, it's might show me that there's incremental [spend] and the incremental might be overstated. So I just got to like balance how we're doing those asks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I know that analytics is working on getting it smarter in terms of like, OK, it's capping out at this time based off of like percent of Ad requests that we typically get in click-through rate [CTR] increases. Like they're [analytics] trying to get the calculations to be smarter to make it more accurate for when we reach out. Because the worst thing that could happen is the client doesn't read it [as a spend that is] incremental and then we're still capping out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Additional layer [of complexity] is someone like Target and now Ahold. They use multiple attribution windows. So each brand might have a different 'look back' [for attribution reporting] that they're looking at in terms of what we need to optimise. So some people on Target may be doing a 14-day halo look [back], some may be doing a 30 day and some may be using the platform data. So they've built this [Attribution Look Back Window in DataGrid] so I can choose, OK, they're going to do a 30 day look back, but they don't care about in-store. So I can choose AdManager only or they only care about in-store [DataGrid Look Back report options to select radio buttons for AdManager Only or InStore only]. So I would select that. Or by unselecting it [checkboxes], it would do both of them together.",DataGrid, Target, In-Store, Ahold Delhaize, AdManager,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Then we have multiple reports down here [Placements & Platform Reports in DataGrid] that we look at to make optimisations. Because we can't do anything to segment App, Web and Mobile [platform metrics listed in report], that's just a nice to know. But it would be nice to be able to 'plus up' on an app versus a web, especially during key periods like goPuff is heavy app user versus web. So I might want to bid more on the app but pull it back on the mobile web or on the desktop. So that there's a balance of where performance is coming from.",DataGrid, Limitation, Mobile, Reporting, goPuff,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But we do also utilise this placement report [in DataGrid] to understand exactly how each category or placement is performing. So on this, I don't know, I don't think everyone, but I might uncap PDP on Target because it's actually outperforming the two other campaigns here and bid more aggressively on that. So this is kind of an indicator to us of how that is. And then down here [Campaign Report in DataGrid], I can individually see from a campaign perspective how that is performing at a total sales, same SKU or view through [Same SKU View Through Units column in DataGrid]. However, the client wants to see that and that's how I inform it. But again, we're missing the piece of what's the average winning bid there to be able to out-win that. And also, you know, what are the other CTR's that we're competing against in order to kind of trick the algorithm to push those forward? [Wants & Needs] [Guidance] [Metrics] [Insights]",DataGrid, SKU, Campaigns, PDP (Product Display Page), CTR (Click Thru Rate),,,,,,,,,,,,,
We also have this keyword discovery tool [in DataGrid] to help us understand.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It becomes more complicated because of how we changed our algorithm and that being more CTR-based than bid-based. So I think just knowing where the other people are or the competitors, especially for managed service are in terms of click-through rate [CTR], we would be able to make appropriate optimisations from a SKU level towards keywords. Or stop the campaign altogether and re-putting it into the algorithm by starting it [the campaign] over, and putting it back into that. That was at 20% where it's the bid to try and get it to win again. But we would do that based on optimisation of the products that we have against those keywords.

Yeah. We are at time figure as much.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I think we didn't really touch on where we think the API is lacking at this point. I know Jaclyn sent some points over to Dean. But setting up a team to Pacvue to get it ready is quite a process. So how can we optimise that?,API, Gap (Product or Service), Pacvue, Partners, Customer needs,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I don't know if we'll do that in 45 minutes, but we can try. Have to remember the login. There we go. Just up Pacvue.com for some reason. If you type it in correctly, it brings you to a flower site. So who knows? So, you can when you can see Pacvue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ok. So I'll go back to the templates that we have to create.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So, when the sales process is that contract signed [stage] or at a near contract signed, the salesperson starts to bring in the CSM to talk with the brand and that's where they'll collect assets. If there's time which often there's not, they'll do a kick-off call to go over our offerings; the different things that we need to collect in order to set up the program; what their KPI's are; are hoping to accomplish through the program. And that's where they'll start getting keywords or SKU's. Our team because we are managed service will go through and think of every single keyword we can possibly think of to match their SKU list.",SKU, Campaigns, Assets, Files or Media, KPI, Search terms / Keywords, Program, Planning, Brands, Contracts, Routine activity, Managed service,,,,,,
"So I have Kraft here [in shared spreadsheet]. They break their brands down into these different [category] types. So it'll be Gelatin, Pudding, Jello, Desserts, Sugar Free Pudding. So we take all the SKU's and break them into like categories so that the correct keywords serve against the correct products. So you'll see, we'll have a generic one here. We'll just say 'pudding' or 'pudding mix' or 'boxed pudding', whatever you could think of. But then because our system isn't smart enough to say, Ok, this is a chocolate fudge pudding, if I put in chocolate fudge, it's going to connect those two and serve it. We have to create individual keyword groups to go with every single flavour type that goes within that. So we have a 'banana' one, we have a 'butterscotch', we have a 'chocolate' one, we have a 'lemon' one, we have a 'French vanilla' one, we have a 'vanilla' one, we have 'pistachio', we have the 'swirl', we have the 'sugar free', so that the retailers website does not appear broken when we deliver the Ad into their search grid.",Search terms / Keywords, Google spreadsheet, Excel, SKU, Categories, Planning, Kraft (Heinz/Kraft),,,,,,,,,,,
"And because search is so intentional [for buyers]. Someone who's looking for 'sugar free pudding' wants to see sugar free pudding, not the full sugar pudding. That's why we have to break it down so far. And retailers here in the US are very strict about that. If you have even sometimes like 'fresh banana', you cannot put banana against 'banana pudding' because they don't want their 'fresh banana' grid to be broken with the 'banana pudding' breakdown.",Operations, Buyer behaviour, Search terms / Keywords, Managed service, Planning, Retailers,,,,,,,,,,,,

"I mean, I've talked with James a bit about us owning that [managing suggested search terms], but I don't think we have resources or people to. I mean, that would ultimately  answer, correct me if I'm wrong, matching keywords to SKU's would be a full-time job in my opinion, because we have so many new ones. It could be, we've never served that product before so then someone has to go in and sit there and match all of those.

And they've created the shell of PIO [PlacementsIO] as the salesperson is pitching and going to the brand with what they want to sell to the client.

"It kicks off a work stream where it says workflow step pending. So that is gate checks that the Op's team, the CSM team that Billing sometimes has to do to make sure that the paperwork that's coming in matches the line items in SalesForce that match the line items in PIO. So SalesForce is logging for sales remit and sales pipeline whereas PIO is our CRM solution or our delivery system. So our system talks to PIO with our impression and delivery data, and this then spawns invoices, not to brands but to Dave and team for our internal invoice team to send.",Billing, Planning, Placements IO, Contracts, Business norm, SalesForce, Managed service,,,,,,,,,,,
"So those are other gate checks and I can show you that. That's for us to if, in case something has made it through the workflow and it shouldn't have. We have this gate check pipeline that have different owners as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So you're correct on that Andrew, where weekly or monthly we're responsible to go in, and maybe it'll work, and make sure that there is no so pitching opportunities with outdated dates with no line items.

So all of this is pulling into DataGrid for us to cross check to make sure none of the downstream impacts are have a problem.",Billing, Impact, DataGrid,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So if something has a non-approved line item [in DataGrid gate checks], that means it's against a contract. So why is it [does it] have delivery against it?

Delivery is not recorded for billing things like that.",Date or Time related, DataGrid, Contracts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So you're correct on that, Andrew and that's where this workflow status comes through [in DataGrid gate checks]. So we have to push that through if it's within 5 days of a launch date that requires a operator or lead operator to push it through to make sure that it fits within our time-frame and timelines. Our SLA's is essentially just we keep that at 5 days. Can be faster.",DataGrid, Contracts, Managed service, Business norm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"There's also a check like I said, where the IO and the planned budget matches. So even if it's off one penny [in DataGrid], this will turn red if it doesn't match SalesForce with the budget dates, things like that.",Insertion Order (IO), SalesForce, Budget, Contracts, Managed service,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So once that's set and ready to go, the campaigns and you can see this workflow here. So the start date is less than 5 days. That means it has to be approved by someone.

And then this is the stage it's in right now, which is ready for trafficking.",Managed service, Business norm, Date or Time related, Campaigns, Approvals,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So the CSM has pushed the line items through [in PIO] and that gives a email indicator to the Op's team that this is ready for them to start set up. And this is where we'll have to check, you know, if the rules are there; is a team name in there; is the product server equal to AdManager UI; did we check the IO; and do these line items match what the IO says.

"Similarly, if we get in a revised IO, they would have to come in here [to PlacementsIO] and request a revision which I'm not on the right screen to do that. But it will then again have to go through that same workflow to make sure that the pick new paperwork if it's an incremental or they're cutting budgets or they're changing dates, all of that requires a new contract. And then these [PIO] line items and SalesForce need to be updated as well. SalesForce and Placements[IO] do not speak to each other at this point. It's a limitation. So someone has to update SalesForce, tag someone in chatter. The CSM has to go in here and request the pending changes. They have to then go look in SharePoint for the updated contract [the SL spreadsheet], make sure it matches and then approve it all again. And then because these don't talk to the system, then we have to submit a change request ticket for someone to manually go in [to PlacementsIO] and update every single line item to match either the new budget or the new dates.",Budget, SharePoint, Date or Time related, SalesForce, Limitation, Placements IO, Assets, Files or Media, Contracts, Google spreadsheet, Excel, Manual effort, Insertion Order (IO),,,,,

So then you would just put in [to PIO new ticket subject line] 'Coke Reyes SL Ready for Trafficking'. They then link what we call a bookings folder [SharePoint server link].

So if there's creative assets that are need, if there's keyword lists, things like that, that would be there and they'd hit new ticket [Save button in PIO ticket]. So then I have a ticketing inbox [in PIO sidebar menu] here with different levels and this is I can filter for traffic request and the Kraft Heinz company. So these two are open and ready to be picked up. So Brittney Khorsandian [Director, Client Operations] knows that this is ready to go live. That's where they start the ticket.

"We then take this [campaign data from PIO] and then go in here [to SL spreadsheet] and that's where we would either find a team if it's like Kraft is always going to be live [Always On], so they'll already have a team.

So every wallet has to have this initial number [as listed in PIO, e.g., '8736982_'] and this ending number [e.g., '_1425931']and that's what's going to tie it for billing to each line item.",Campaigns, Data, Placements IO, Google spreadsheet, Excel, Kraft (Heinz/Kraft), Spend, Managed service, Wallets, Contracts, UPC or Identifier, Billing,,,,,,
"And then Katie [McNenney, VP of RMN partnerships] built a bunch of reports to pull that in, or maybe Andrew you did, I don't remember.

If it's still like that, I can show you Coke, they updated it. So this at one point said Coke $0 wallet [in Team Wallets in AdManager UI].

"As you can see, Kraft goes nuts [with large amount of wallets in AdManager ] because they have all the different ways that they break this down.

Pretend this [wallet] is called 'breakfast sausage' and everything within this [SL spreadsheet] tab would need to be tied to that 'breakfast sausage' wallet and everything within the 'cheese tab' [in AdManager] would need to be tied to the 'cheese tab' [SL spreadsheet] because they require billing by sub-brands within their brands.

"Offshore is involved. So offshore picks up the trafficking ticket. Our team doesn't do that unless it's Q4  [quarter 4] and we have hundreds of thousands of campaigns to do. So the trafficking ticket goes to the offshore team after our team has confirmed that all of the assets are there. Like if they send us a trafficking ticket and there is no SL [sponsored listing] template, then that gets closed and goes right back to the CSM that the tickets incomplete and they have to resubmit it. So that's we do that initial check. However, in 2024 that's going to be transitioned to offshore to do those checks so that the onshore team can spend time optimising. So they're trafficking all this. We have a dashboard in here [PIO] called Media Plans and that is creating the wallet names for them but is also acting as a check for it's pulling in from SalesForce, it's pulling in from Placements[IO].

"So if a brand is working with Pacvue directly, meaning they are paying a contract to work with their UI and we are not connecting them to utilise their tools, we have to create the team for them. Our API partners are not able to create teams or wallets [within AdManager]. So often what you'll see is that our offshore teams like SEBPO or internal Ad Op's members will create the team, create the wallets, and then we'll have to invite all the users to that team. And then there are some scenarios where if a partner had previously been running a campaign, or they've previously been running a program where they had a bunch of campaigns, they might ask us to duplicate those and then give them Pacvue access. So we might have done that and for them. But otherwise they are able to create campaigns directly from the [partner] API.",Pacvue, Limitation, Partners, Fees or Charges, Brands, API, SEBPO, Manual effort, Campaigns, Contracts, Managed service, Wallets,,,,,,
"So right now we have only contracted to work with Target just for the internal Op's use. We are only with Target and Ahold [Delhaize]. So right now what we'll do is we will go through the same process of connecting a team as any brand would, in order to make sure that API is talking to the AdManager platform. And then from there we can utilise pretty much all of the same tools that the brands can use. I'm not sure if you've ever seen the Pacvue platform. I could share my screen and take you through it if you'd like.",Managed service, Contracts, API, Pacvue, Ahold Delhaize, Manual effort, AdManager, Target, Brands,,,,,,,,,
"So if we received a new brand that we haven't worked with yet, we would have to create that team from the Target UI. So right now our API partners do not have the ability to create teams or wallets. So all of that piece would still be the normal process [for Ad Op's team]. We would create a new team from Target retailer team and create the wallet and then add the funds. Our API partners are also not able to add funds through that connection. So all of that would take place in the AdManager portal. And then we have an intake form that Pacvue requires us to complete in order to make the [API] connection. And then once the team is created, we just need that team ID as the final piece. Complete the intake form and then providing the team ID to Kevin M on our API partners team for AdManager. And then usually takes like 48 to 72 hours for a new team to be visible in the Pacvue platform. Then once the team is visible from the drop down [menu in Pacvue], we can search any team. One thing that we have noticed with Pacvue, essentially is that, if we are utilising the platform for multiple retailers like Target and Ahold [Delhaize] - we used to use it for Albertsons - we have to just rename the team to call that out [i.e. reflect different retailers in  the team names]. Otherwise, if we're working with Energizer across multiple retailer platforms, we won't be able to tell that from Pacvue because we don't have a way to filter by different retailers. So we would rename the team to call out the retailer that particular campaigns are tied to. Another thing that is a bit of a limitation with the Pacvue platform is that they don't have wallets, so something that we have to do to kind of group campaigns together, to make sure that anything that we set up applies to the campaigns that utilising the same wallet, is create campaign tags. So that's usually something that we do inside each individual team, [in Pacvue] we'll create a [campaign] tag that matches the wallet name, and then we'll have to tag all of the campaigns that are pulling from that wallet so that if we're creating reports or automation specific to that wallet we'ill have to use the campaign tag.",Brands, Target, Albertsons, Ahold Delhaize, Retailers, Managed service, Campaigns, Pacvue, On-boarding, Partners, Business norm, Wallets, UPC or Identifier, API, Manual effort, AdManager, Limitation, Tagging
"Yes. So it is all customisable [in Pacvue]. They have three different tagging options [in Pacvue for tagging - Campaign, Product of Keyword tagging]. The one that we utilise as the Campaign tag and it kind of matches to the AdManager platform. So since we can't make any sort of edits across keywords without going into the campaign, tagging keyword wouldn't necessarily allow us to do any sort of automation. It would only allow us to pull specific reports at a keyword tag level. So for the purposes of setting up any sort of bulk operations or automation, we use the Campaign tag [in Pacvue]. And you can create as many campaign tags. You can create sub-tags. So if you have a number of campaigns tagged tied to a wallet, but then within those campaigns maybe there's also like branded campaigns that you want to separate out, you could create a sub-tag. We don't really utilise this at the moment. We're just focusing on tying all the campaigns to their wallet and then once we've done that, you are able to set things up at the campaign tag level. So you can set up reports. You can set up bidding automation [based on tags] and then you can also set up day-parting. So here you can see these are all of our tags of filter for a recent tag [went through tag filtering for Harry's brand in Pacvue on shared screen].",Filter, Automation, Campaigns, Pacvue, Routine activity, Bulk actions, Search terms / Keywords, UPC or Identifier, Reporting, Wallets, Tagging,,,,,,,

"But here you can see this is a campaign tag for their hair care wallet. So this has like shampoo and conditioner. We have the five campaigns that we have tagged to this wallet [indicated in Pacvue report table under Campaigns column]. And then we get all the reporting bubbled up to the campaign level [i.e. Impressions, Clicks, CTR, Spend, CPC, CPA, CVR (conversion rate), ACOS (advertising cost of sales)]. So this is the essentially the only way to get reporting at the wallet level from within Pacvue [using tags]. Otherwise you would have to just download all the campaigns and pivot it out yourself because they don't have a wallet as a filter. They don't recognise wallets in their API.",API, Impressions, ACoS (Advertising Cost of Sales), Wallets, Limitation, CPC (Cost Per Click), Pacvue, Gap (Product or Service), Reporting, Campaigns, Spend, UPC or Identifier, CPA (Cost Per Action), Tagging,,,,
"And then from here [filtered reporting in Pacvue] we have a couple of different things that we could do. We could add a sub-tag. We can edit this tag. We can add a rule you can parse out daily data. You can delete the tag. You can merge into a shared tag [assume it would allow 2 separate tags to be merged together for reporting under the one tag]. I'm not sure exactly what that is. What we've mostly been doing is using tags to set up things like [optimisation] rules and day-parting. So this currently has a rule. If we go over to their bulk operation or sorry, they're optimisation dashboard, they have dayparting rules and budget scheduler. And so one of the things that we were really interested in in this platform is setting up rules, because Target is actually on a first price auction. So whereas like the Grocery Network, Petco, some of our other retailers are going to 2nd price auction [and] is able to like increase those bids automatically based on competition, we have to increase all of the Target bids manually. So with the rules, we're able to say, run this weekly. It tells us the last time it was executed and the next time it's going to run. It will tell you the number of campaigns effected [by the rule]. If we go into edit this rule you can see what we have set up. So right now everything is in PST, that's one of the limitations that we have with Pacvue, we're not able to select Eastern Time zones. But we can choose to have it notify us [via email option] when the rule runs. So you can either choose email me every time this rule runs or just email me if there are changes made based on the criteria. And then you choose your campaign tag. We also have the option to exclude pause campaigns. And then you can set up your requirements. So right now we have been mostly utilising things like ROAS, click through rate impressions and sales. But you have a lot you can pretty much choose from all of the data brackets that we send them. And then you can choose custom choose based on ROAS, whatever your metric that you're looking at.",Day-parting, Reporting, Grocery Network / Grocery One, Bulk actions, Filter, Pacvue, UPC or Identifier, Limitation, Optimisation, Target, Petco, Automation, Bidding, ROAS, Retailers, Tagging,,
"Yeah. So those are the requirements [optimisation rule requirements in Pacvue]. So I've chosen ROAS and I've said if the ROAS is greater than $0.65 then for the action taken you can increase the bid of that campaign by 6% up to [a bid limit] $6 and you're going to look at the data from the last 7 days, excluding the last two days. So the last two days in the Pacvue platform's going to be today and yesterday. So it's really more like just excluding one day, but you're also not counting data that's from today. And then I can choose the frequency of how often I want this to run. So you can choose everything from daily to every 2, 3 [or] 4 weeks, every two weeks. You have a lot of options to choose from. You can choose the day and since I chose weekly, I can choose the day and time that it runs. This is only looking at the same ROAS that we have in the UI, which is 14-day, same SKU click. So that's why I have it as kind of a low ROAS just because these clients are actually measuring enhanced attribution. But since we're not able to use that, I've set the requirement [bidding] a little bit lower. And then you can add more requirements. So if the requirement that we want is the client is interested in conversions and CPC or something like that, just really depending on what the client's KPI's' are, I can say the ROAS has to be $0.65 and the CPC has to be lower than a dollar. If it's already over a dollar, don't increase it. We could also put whatever cap [spend limit]. So for this one I put $6 since the price point of these products is a little bit higher. But it lets us cap at any dollar amount that we would like. You can choose to increase at a percentage level or the dollar level.

"Yes. So with the release of bid by keyword, we have found that [in Pacvue] we are not able to automatically change all bids within a campaign if we have adjusted anything utilising bid by keyword [in AdManager]. So if we've trafficked a bunch of new campaigns and we've kept everything at the same CPC, the automation works. It's the same limitation we're seeing with day-parting. So we will use day-parting to say, OK, starting on weekends, we see more traffic, so we want to increase bids for the weekend. So we'll say like increase bids Friday through Sunday by 50% and then on Monday reduce them back down. It only works on campaigns that have not implemented bid by keyword [in AdManager]. I'm guessing you're familiar with bid by keyword [previously only had bid by campaign in AdManager].",Automation, Errors or Issues, Business challenge, Bidding, Search terms / Keywords, Pacvue, CPC (Cost Per Click), AdManager,,,,,,,,,,
"Yes, they're right.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yeah, bids by search term. So that's a huge limitation [Pacvue optimisation not working with campaigns in AdManager using bid by keyword]. Obviously, we had a lot of use of that when it first rolled out was like exciting to be able to do that [in AdManager], especially when thinking about how to optimise campaigns. But then we realised that it was not actually taking effect for any of the automation [set up in Pacvue]. So we're still setting up all the automation because it only happens if you have done bid by keyword, and you might not have. So it's a little bit tricky. So we're still just like utilising the automation [in Pacvue] and hoping for the best basically.",Bidding, Search terms / Keywords, Limitation, AdManager, Pacvue, Automation, Errors or Issues, Campaigns,,,,,,,,,,
"Yeah, I think it's a couple of different things. When bid by keyword was released [in AdManager], Pacvue was informed that we were releasing it, but I think there was... I can't really necessarily speak to like the build of everything, but I think they just found that we weren't able to... They're [Pacvue are] not able to touch like keyword-level data. So that's another reason why they have the option to tag keywords [using Tagging in Pacvue] and so other partners that they have, they can tag keywords, they could set automation at the keyword level where our platform is kind of campaign level first and then you have to dig in deeper to get to the keyword. So it sounded like from the conversations that we've had [with Pacvue], they just don't have, they're not able to override the campaign level. So like in a campaign, I can pull up... [Harry's campaigns in AdManager] they have basically a setting for campaign level CPC and then underneath that keyword level CPC's. So like in our platform you have that apply all section [within the Strategy section of the Campaign setup flow under the Set maximum cost per click across your Search Terms field]. This box here where you have 'Apply to all' [button.] As soon as you hit apply all, it rules this campaign out for being able to apply automation [within Pacvue's optimisation rules].  You would have to just put it in here [individually add Max bids against each search term line item instead] and let it trickle down. So what we're finding is that the automation will run [in Pacvue] and it will just change this, but it won't do like an apply to all [max bid setting] thing on its own. So if we had a rule in place, you might come in here [in AdManager] and see this [Apply to all] says that it was increased, but these [line item search terms] were not.",Optimisation, Bidding, Search terms / Keywords, Business challenge, AdManager, UPC or Identifier, CPC (Cost Per Click), Pacvue, Automation, Errors or Issues, Tagging,,,,,,,
"So the automation for bid increases [in Pacvue] is really great. They also have a history log [of campaign optimisations]. You can also copy a rule, so if you want to just keep all of the requirements and everything, you can copy it onto the next wallet. The history log is something that we don't have in the [AdManager] UI, so this is really great. We could come in and see that bids were changed. What they used to be, what they are now and like when it happened. They also have a task center [in Pacvue] which we don't have in the [AdManager] UI. So we can see if day-parting ran, if a bulk event took place, if a rule took place, if a budget took place. And you can also see, I forget exactly how, but I believe in the record you can see who was logged in, which user. This one [campaign] is old and turned off, so that's why it's failing. But that's really helpful when we're trying to investigate things, especially if clients are making changes. You can see here it says 'non manual' [under the Task Center table column 'User Account']. That means that it was run through Pacvue versus running through AdManager.",Pacvue, Competitor advantage, Date or Time related, Reporting, Good experience, Campaigns, Automation, Day-parting, Bidding,,,,,,,,,
"So recently we had a bunch of campaigns and when we logged into the platform Monday morning, we found a bunch of campaigns, or I think it was Friday maybe, a bunch of campaigns were moved to pending status at like 4.00 AM Eastern [time]. So we knew that something happened during the night, that obviously none of our team was online. We were able to come into here and see what happened was a day-parting event where the idea was to increase bids and this [Task Center] allowed us to investigate because obviously it’s now failing but at the time had succeeded last week. And it allowed us to come in and see that day-parting was turned on for something that shouldn't. Basically, it shouldn't have been turned on. It shouldn't have ran, but also it shouldn't push campaigns into a pending status. Like if the request is just to increase the bid that doesn't require additional campaign review and approval. So that helped the Ad Op's team to be able to troubleshoot on our own because otherwise we wouldn't really know. We're just flagged campaigns were moved to pending and we don't know why. You also have the option to revert changes. So if a rule ran, like we had a couple of rules run yesterday and you could see the history of those, you can also like go back as far as you need to to review any time that a rule ran. But you can select them and choose revert so that you undo any CPC changes all at once, if you'd like to. So, we've just found this handy to be able to kind of look back this way and could see changes that you might have done like campaign bid increases that might have happened three weeks ago. Whereas if you look in the [AdManager] UI, you would have to download the report and then work backwards by dividing the cost by the number of clicks since when you download the report it's only going to show you the current CPC.

"Yes. So once you have your team and wallet created you can actually do all of the campaigns through this bulk function. Our recent limitation that we were not experiencing a few months ago is that we're finding the PST time zone [Pacific Srtandard Time] is a little bit hindering. So we'll bulk upload something, and since  most of our team is in Eastern Time zone [EST], when we look at it in the [AdManager] UI, if it was supposed to end January 31st, we're finding that it says February 1st. But we are able to use templates that they have [using Download template button within Pacvue]. So you could download a template and if you have like 10 campaigns to upload, you can just use their workbook [Excel spreadsheet]. But you can just put the campaign name, the placement type, the wallet ID, all of this information and go line by line [in the spreadsheet]. It's the same for each tab [i.e Definitions, Campaign, Product, Keyword tabs in the Excel spreadsheet]. So as long as you've provided the campaign name, you can add all of the SKU's, and line by line if you have 10 campaigns. Same thing with keywords. Then you could just save and upload this template and it will create all the campaigns for you. You'll still have to go into the Target UI to approve them. But we are able to do bulk campaign creation using that template. They also have bulk operations within campaigns [in Pacvue]. So time he's going to let this load. You can select multiple campaigns and do things like, pause them all at once, if you need to. Or if they were paused, move them all to enabled. You can change the bid all at once, or if you need to change the end date. Once a campaign is trafficked, we don't have the ability to change the start date in Pacvue, for some reason. I'm not sure why, but we can bulk change the end date. So if we have the campaign that we're going to be adding more funds and extending the program then we can do that all in bulk versus in the [AdManager] UI going line by line. You can also bulk use any of these operations [i.e. State, Settings, Products, Keywords, Campaign Tag, Optimization Rules, Day-parting, Budget Schedule]. So keyword Ad products. They have the day-parting setting. So you can choose a bunch of different campaigns and then if you want to say like tomorrow increase all these bids $0.50 you can do that.

But we do have that ability, core bulk functionality if the time zones work.",Pacvue, Time Zones, Date or Time related, Competitor advantage, Positive feedback,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So I am piece-mealing information as I hear it, so I could be wrong. But I believe one of the issues is that we are sending them [Pacvue] data only like once per day versus hourly. So if we can send them hourly data, the idea is that it they would be able to choose a different time zone, and I might be saying all of that information wrong. It's a little bit outside of my knowledge of how the API connection works. But right now we just they only have PST. They're telling us that we're only sending them data in PST [time format] for whatever reason.",Date or Time related, Pacvue, Errors or Issues, Time Zones,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yeah, I'm not 100% clear on that, but they're [Pacvue] saying basically that it's coming from our end. And then I guess somebody told Katy [Keane] that a solution would be these hourly buckets. So we're hoping that that is a solution. They also have this report section which if it works is really awesome because you can set up custom reports. Right now we are investigating why their data is different than DataGrid data because we're finding that DataGrid data has captured a lot more impressions and clicks versus what their [Pacvue] reports saying for things like enhanced attribution. And Target, really pretty much all of our clients are just looking at enhanced attribution. So we're not utilising this [Reports] section right now. But it would be a huge lift off of operations plate if we were able to just create these reports and have them set to run automatically versus pulling them all the time. So that's one of the kinks that we're trying to work out. And then they also have a competitor analysis report, which is really different than what we have access to in DataGrid because it includes all Ad calls. So they are actually just crawling the Target site and they're able to show like for this Harry's [mens' brand] report, they're able to show organic search results as well as advertised search results.

One  limitation with this is just we have to set up the monitoring. So if we launch a new brand today, we have to go in and create the report. It won't look back at anything historical.

"The second most interesting thing is bulk actions, which they typically prefer let's say I want to adjust the budget of this 3 or 4 campaigns. I can select as many campaigns and I click on adjust budget and I say make it a daily budget. And whatever is the budget you increase the budget by let's say 15%. Like click on Apply so it gets applied on the AdManager platform. So, there are like various actions users can take like changing the status, and you know, budget and everything. Removing the SKU’s; adding SKU’s. I will not go into other two tabs [Ad SKU's and Keywords in CommerceIQ], it pretty much same along the keyword and SKU’s.",SKU, Bulk actions, Search terms / Keywords, Optimisation, Budget, CommerceIQ, Competitor advantage,,,,,,,,,,,

"So there is two different things. So we use this platform and take actions on AdManager that you use our key. Like let's say whatever the common email ID we have given like CIQ underscore, app underscore, something. So we use that particular user ID and the key to take all actions. Now all the users, they have their own credentials. Because if I go to users. Here you can see these are our users and there you see there are brand users from Kellogg. There will be agency users. And each one of them have their own user ID and password. So they use their user ID and password and when they log in they see this particular portal [i.e. CommerceIQ dashboard]. Does that answer your question?",Integrations, CommerceIQ, AdManager, Access,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yes. Because some users, I think if you'll see some users are deactivated, they might have left the organization or moved out. So we deactivated from here so they can no longer access our platform. So we manage the users ourselves, but still we have contract with our clients. We connect to AdManager using our common credentials. The moment the contract is over, someone else takes the contract, then they send email or note to AdManager and they take over the write and read access from us and give it to the new provider.",AdManager, CommerceIQ, On-boarding, Business norm, Contracts, Access, Integrations,,,,,,,,,,,

"Then we have something proprietary called Market Insights where we, say that what is your share of voice?

This is Kellogg, so how it is performing on an organic basis for generic keywords or let's say all keywords. So what it shows that on the generic keyword and an organic level, your share of voice is 4.9%. So like if there are 100 places you are in the search page, coming around on flight 5 places. So your competitor [to Kellogg] like, Good & Gather there are coming in 20 places, right? Frito-Lay [another Kellogg competitor] coming in around 3.6% of the places.

But if I go below and say waffles, we have actually increased your Share of Voice by 4.3%. So that's how we showed them [brands] and what they can do about it. They can say, OK, snacks, we are losing share of voice. Maybe they will go to the campaign management tool in the keyword section, search for snacks and they increase the bid by 10% or 15%. Or they  will have some written [optimisation] rules that will automatically do that. But yeah, I think overall that's the concept. Like how you are performing on the retailer website.

Here they will see OK, this is snacks, and they can see the campaign name actually and if they want to filter by certain campaign they can do that very well. But if not, they can take action on all the campaigns they want. Oh OK, we have not integrated [with AdManager API] the keyword bid, that's why this action is not coming [appearing in CommerceIQ UI].

"Yeah. I think one of the important thing I don't know if it is enabled like last time when we discussed there were certain things that were not available.

So that is one concern we have to take it from the client, if we do [need to set up campaigns]. Second is I think at that time for here it's not allowing you to select categories. Yeah, so this information, I think we don't have [minimum bids on keywords available]. But this is not editable [adjust bids], but I think there were some retailer where you just wanted to edit campaigns and that option was not there.

"Yeah, they're very API. We have so most of the things are available through the API, so we do have campaign creation enabled. I think the biggest thing [to enable] will be the catalog. Because what happens is some users, so this is a lot of catalogs. If there is a new SKU the client have added and they have to come and update the catalog first here [in AdManager] or in CIQ then only they can create the campaign.

"So catalog will be the first thing because catalog not only in campaign creation, we use in various other places like, they [brands] want to view minimum bid. Or they want to add a product from the catalog to a campaign. So those are the places where they need it. So currently we get the catalog manually while we onboarding the client. Again, this catalog is sometimes not up to date, so those issues will fail. So catalog will be one thing. I have to revisit this, but whatever I can do on AdManager platform with the same thing I can do on through the API. If all the functionalities are available then, definitely that will be a big boost for us to enable this to user. See this [wallet] balance and all.

"No, just are there any other questions? I want to cover one more thing before we have some feedback.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"OK, so this is the last one. So what we do is we give some kind of optimisation or rule builder where the users can use this rules [shared Campaign Optimizer in CommerceIQ]. So they have to create these rules once, and once the rules are created based on certain parameter, this rules will run. Let's say I create some strategy to improve ROAS. Now we only have campaign-level function, so I say for all campaigns. So let's say for last 30 days if I see, let's say ROAS is greater than $2.00. What I will see, OK, this campaign is doing really well. So either you increase the bid by 10% or you know you change the budget by 10%, right? Because what I want to do, I want to spend my media with dollars on the campaigns when it's doing well. Then where the campaign is not doing well. Once we have keyword, there will be another scope for keyword as well. So we can increase or decrease the bid for keyword. So that’s the automation that we have.",CommerceIQ, Optimisation, Campaigns, ROAS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So, 3 [optimisation] rules we use. So one is ROAS. Otherwise one is we have a proprietary metrics called iROAS. This is called incremental ROAS.

When is not doing organically or you can put more money. This one, share of voice, I showed you.",CommerceIQ, Optimisation, ROAS, Competitor advantage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Other thing that, this again comes back to catalog which our users do on other retailer platforms is reduce this out of stock risk, right. So basically they see what is the available inventory on hand and based on the available inventory [physical stock] that if it is less than certain threshold they pause the campaign or they remove the SKU's, so that that is something they do.

"Yeah, hi. So currently, it would be great if you guys like provide SKU-level API now. So currently if we have to add SKU's in our product so we have to use the campaign API, campaign-level update API now. So in the API what we do so,  suppose that in a campaign, we have already added 5 SKU, right? So first we have to fetch all the SKU's and then we want to add a 2 new SKU's. Then we need to append 2 SKU's in that list, and then we hit back the updated with the 7 SKU’s, right? So this is the kind of functionality like current implemented. But now it would be great if you provide like another API which will be just using to append the SKU's, right. So we don't need to fetch the entire list. What we need to do, we just need to pass the new SKU's in that using that API. So that's the thing, like we were looking [at]. So we have this functionality for other retailers. So here like we are just using the campaign-level API.",Limitation, API, SKU, Errors or Issues, Campaigns, Partners,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yeah. So data, we have like, OK, what are my entities, right? So if you see top-level, my entities are campaigns, SKU's and keyword. Now how do I update now we have keyword level bids as well, right? How do I update a keyword-level bid only for one keyword for a particular campaign? I cannot do that, so I have to hit the complete campaign API. I have to do a 'GET' call I believe to see if someone is not updated bid in AdManager portal and then based on that I have to change it. Otherwise, let's say someone has updated 1 keyword, we have 3 keywords, and we fetch the data once in 24-hours, right. So every day at maybe 10.00 AM or something, we will pull the data from your database, and we will include it. And till next day 10.00 AM there will be no communication with AdManager. Now let's say someone has added 1 keyword after we pull that data, we don't have that information and user is trying to change the bid from our system. So what we will do, we will push the entire campaign API, right and what it will do, it will overwrite the campaign that you have and they will lose the keyword they have added in the AdManager portal. So that is the that is one of the challenge we get.

"That's a good question. I don't know under whose bucket it falls. So some of the retailers they give us hourly-level data as well. I know it might be under the other team, but tell me if it is under the other team.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"OK. Yeah, that that would be helpful. Like if we get every hour how my campaign is doing, so that [I can understand] what I can do. Maybe I know between 12.00 AM to 5.00 AM. My campaign is spending a lot of money, but there is no sales happening. So what I will do, I will reduce my bid for the campaign during that particular period of time. So we had that feature, we were not built [it yet]. That is the day-parting feature or our limited feature we call that we are currently building, which will be live in this quarter. But [if] you have to optimally use that feature, it will require, OK, how do I know which hour the campaigns or the keywords are performing well. So what we have seen is people have some budget, but that budget gets over [spends entirely] within early part of the morning, or 3.00 PM. And the rest of the time, the campaign is out of budget if the campaign budget type is down. So that's one of the thing that is important.

So do you handle Europe as well or is it only US?",UK, USA, Optimisation, Campaigns, Spend, Integrations, CommerceIQ, Day-parting, Bidding,,,,,,,,,
"So we I think integrated with Sainsbury, which is for UK. So there we found one thing interesting thing is, Sainsbury doesn't support daily-level budget. It only supports the life-time budget [budget set for a campaign duration].",CommerceIQ, Operations, Sainsburys, UK, Budget,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"OK. I think that was like a big [issue] because I will tell you the problem. Like, they will put budget like let's say I have a budget of $500.00 for this month. And what have happened is that that $500.00 will get over [spent] within first 10 days. Rest [remaining] 20 days, they will have no budget. So they asked us to manually place the budget like let's say there is $500.00 or let's say $600.00. So each day $20.00 [budget top-up], so they say that go every day to the campaigns and put $20.00 so that I last for like 30 days. So that was one of the challenges we faced. But yeah, if it is a retailer flag, I don't think we can do much.",Errors or Issues, Budget, AdManager, Business challenge,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"OK. I don't recollect but if you want, I can definitely create some document or something. Like I have never thought from that perspective except the catalog part and this getting API's for the keyword and SKU's. But if you want, I can definitely put something [in writing].",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yeah. So since we have not enabled campaign creation for AdManager, we have not seen that request. But let's say this happens, typically at the beginning of the quarter when the clients have new budget or their launching a new set of products. So they give us say that OK launch maybe 5, [or] 10 campaigns. Another thing is, even if they have 1 product, still we have to launch bulk campaign because the way we categorise the campaign. So we have 1 campaign for let's say I think there are multiple categories, placements right, PDP category, search. Within search also we can have like these are my top performing keywords. I want to provide more bid, so that is one campaign. These are my [long] tail keywords so I will create another campaign. So there could be multiple campaigns for one product. So if you get 4 or 5 products, then there could be like a lot of campaigns. So, that's where bulk. So since we have not used AdManager, don't get that request.

"So what Ad Op's usually receives for sponsored products is what we refer to as an SL template [Sponsored Listing], so sponsored listings template. The CSM will create this based on the products that the client provides us. So, they'll break everything out into campaigns where the keywords are aligned with the types of products. So in this example [shared SL Listing spreadsheet] this is for GoPro, so that we only have 4 products and we've broken it out into different keyword groupings. So in this campaign, it's for all cameras. And this campaign, we've broken out branded [groups], so it includes the GoPro brand in the keyword description. And then further breakouts. So this one has a specific the Hero 12 [product]. They've started adding Hero 12 in the branded terms. And again Hero 11, Hero 10 [GoPro products], breaking things out like that. This one is a bundle, so we have, you know like 5 or 6 campaigns to create and in the AdManager UI what we would do is go into the team. And for this example I'll just use our test team. But you would go into the team, create a new campaign, and then you have to select the settings each time you create a new campaign. So if I'm creating all keyword, I would choose search, create my campaign name, and then my dates. So every time you create a campaign, you have to re-select search, create the campaign name. Re-select the dates, select the wallet again, and then add your products. So we do have a bulk function in the AdManager UI. You can download a template where you can bulk upload, what Target calls their TCIN's [Target Catalog Identification Number] which is just like the SKU's that the client has given us. So we do have that available in the AdManager UI. The only thing where it doesn't work is if a product comes in different sizes and colours like a T-shirt. We wouldn't be able to use bulk for something like that.",Bulk actions, Campaigns, Managed service, GoPro, Products, Routine activity, SPA (Sponsored Product Ads), Limitation, Date or Time related, SKU, Planning, Search terms / Keywords, AdManager, Business norm, Target, Excel,,
"Yes. So the way that Target [shared AdManager instance for Target], the way that I guess the team, I'm not sure where the terminology was originally thought of, but we've always referred to them as a parent TCIN and then a child TCIN. So if you click on a T-shirt, you can see obviously extra-large in brown, is it owned TCIN, and then extra-large and red has its own GTIN, Black has its own. So each one of these sizes has each one of these colours of its own GTIN. But then at the top you can see in the URL [on the Target website], here it says a dash and then this number [i.e. A-90003723 from the URL string]. So this is what we've always referred to as the parent TCIN and then the pre-select as the child TCIN whichever colour and size this goes to. So at the first beginning of trafficking the Target catalog, we were only ever able to use parent TCIN's. And then throughout one of the releases, they were able to include the child TCIN's in the catalog. But now when you use the bulk template, if you put in parent TCIN's it will just choose at random one of these [any of the child TCIN's]. So you have to actually use all of them. You can't just use the group like the parent grouping. So you can use child TCIN. You just have to make sure that you have all of them, otherwise in the UI we can do, if we just go one-by-one, we can just grab [them]. Sometimes the clients will only have the parent TCIN's and so that's what they'll send us. But we then have the option to see like this [parent TCIN] comes in 82 variations. We could add all 82, but you just can't do that in bulk. It we'll just pick one [a child TCIN] at random.",Catalog (retailer), Limitation, Operations, Target, Bulk actions, UPC or Identifier, Parent-Child,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yes. So there are standard naming convention will take whatever the CSM has labelled the campaign. So 'All cameras' would be the campaign name and then depending on the placement type, if it's search we usually do ‘KW’ for keyword and then will take the campaign name that the CSM has created. And then we end the campaign with the PIO [Placements IO] ID [i.e. example on screen was named 'KW_ALL_CAMERAS_1445847']. So PIO like Garcia Remen finance system and so in here, each campaign has a PIO ID. So we just tag that at the end of all campaigns.

"Well, we put the PIO [Placements IO] ID in the wallet for billing, but we usually include it in the campaign name just to make sure, cause oftentimes we'll have multiple campaigns in one team. And then this way we can see like this was the 2024 campaign. There might have been one from last year or maybe they break them out by quarters. So this is just another easy way to help us when we're like searching for campaigns or trying to stay organized with all the campaigns being there.",Placements IO, Billing, Routine activity, Campaigns,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yes. Some scenarios you might, yeah.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Sure. So then you would add your products from the template. And then like, oftentimes we can see like this product, says Black [GoPro product]. But because the electronics, it might not have additional variations of the same way that a T-shirt does. But oftentimes, like we just received this, so we don't necessarily know if it comes in different colours. And so usually the first time that we're finding that out is in the trafficking process. So we would add all 4 [products]. Understood, go with one for now and then next page you would add your keywords and you can do a bulk upload for keywords. So you just download the template [from AdManager]. The template has a first row of code, so this search underscore term has to stay in the template and then you would just add your keywords here. This does have a limit of 100 keywords, including the line of code, so if any point we have a campaign that has more than 100 [keywords], we have to break it into multiple templates.",Search terms / Keywords, GoPro, Bulk actions, Products, Manual effort, AdManager, Parent-Child,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yes, we might do like when we get the trafficking ticket, we might just do like a quick review. If their [customers] list was much shorter, I might come up with some keywords to add. Or I might just review to make sure that they didn't add any branded terms just because of Targets’ business rules, we're not allowed to bid on competing branded terms. So that's really the only scenario. Since this one is so many keywords, and it's well built out, I probably wouldn't add any in this case. But there are some scenarios where you would do like a quick scan and see like oh they forgot to add this or they didn't think of this and you'd add those in.",Target, Search terms / Keywords, Campaigns, Brands, Competitor, Routine activity, Managed service,,,,,,,,,,,
"Well for me, we have separate account lists. So we're often getting campaigns with similar types of products. The account will be kind of broken out by category. So for this seller, CSM team and Ad operations team, they often are in the electronics category, so they might have brands that run with a lot of the same keywords. And that often helps you know you see like GoPro is bidding on video camera, drone, stuff like that and then they get another small camera that doesn't have as many of those keywords. So usually it's just like quick top-of-mind from working with the keywords all the time. But if I opened a template that just didn't seem like it had a ton, I would often like go to the Target website and pull up the product and figure out ways that they talk about the product from their product page [PDP page]. So  the details like what do they talk about, is this waterproof? Would they waterproof camera and stuff like that. Or we have like a couple other tools that we'll use.

"I have not actually done had to do any. A lot of our programs have been live for like 6 months. Usually we do a lot more like you were describing at the beginning, but then after 5 months of looking for keywords you usually run out. But one that we've been working on a lot has been razors. Obviously, there's only like, it's kind of a niche product. There's so many ways to that people are going to type in a search keyword to find razors. So if the product is women’s razors, I'll use the search bar on Target as well, because it often starts auto-filling based on the searches that they're seeing. So you'll like kind of just start typing and see what comes up. See if we have any of these keywords and if they make sense for the product. The more you add, the more you know, if you keep adding spaces and things the keywords will change. So this is one place that will start with, specifically the Target site. And then based on you'll go to your actual product that you're working with and look at the product description [PDP] and see what are things that they say. So it has five blades. You might add something like 5 blade razor. If it talks about being disposable, you maybe would add disposable razor kit. Things that you might find within this product description. Then we'll also sometimes just use Google and see what's suggested. Things come up from Google. We'll also use WordStream is one that will use sometimes so. You can actually use the product UPC and here this is just a free tool, and it will only stay free for like the first page. But this is one that will sometimes be helpful. It'll come up with a list of keywords. We'll you ChatGPT where you can go in and say I need a list of exact match keywords for a sponsored product? Sometimes Google Ad keywords, we'll use. And then the last one we'll use is DataGrid to look at keywords that other retailers and similar brands might have run. So if we go to like, we have a keyword discovery dashboard [in DataGrid]. But that's only going to show you the top like, I think they've only mapped the top 10,000 [keywords]. Maybe so if we go to like the optimization dashboard, we can go down to keywords and by and just like type in 'pickles' and it will show like 'kosher Pickles', 'dill pickles'. It'll show you the list of every keyword that has ever been in a campaign. So that will help, especially if you're not filtering by retailer. You can see like what other retailers used as keywords.

"Yeah. And then you can just save and drag the template into here [the Search step in Campaign Setup in AdManager]. Once you have added those terms or you could also just type. It's always [keywords] delimited by a comma. So you can add as many that way if you want to, or just add one at a time. And then the last page is the Strategy page.

"Yeah, right wow we're using that more to help determine what the Max bid should be. So if we have like a ton of keywords like 'coffee', 'ground coffee', 'decaf coffee' and then we'll see like 'ground coffee' is actually really highly searched right now, then we might say like, let's increase the bid for that keyword higher than the rest because it's seeing a lot more searches and we'll have to be more competitive.",Bidding, Search terms / Keywords, Business strategy, Competitor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I would say like 3 [bars] or higher. Oftentimes it won't be filled in at all [the blue bar serach volum indicator in the Strategy step], depending on the type of keywords that you're using? I was just going to say I'm actually surprised by how little this is. I would have thought there would have been more variation [of search volumes shown for the keywords] in this. In the in the search value like to me, this feels like a mistake. I can't imagine that coffee and pudding have the same search volume. So to me this feels like not trustworthy, to check it out right now. But like sometimes you would see like a proper distinction between [search volumes]. Yeah, like there's no way that bicycle and coffee have the same search volume. But sometimes you do actually see a distinction where you don't have all 5 bars filled in [for search volumes], and so then you might say like if 5 of the keywords that I've added here only have 2 blue lines. But my 6th and 7th one have 4 or 5 that I might increase the bid on those two.",Positive feedback, Understanding vague, UI, Search terms / Keywords,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So this is supposed to be data from the last 30 days. So I would just assume that a ton of people are constantly searching for coffee and not as many people are constantly searching for things like pudding, or bicycle, or hat. Like I can't imagine people are typing in 'hat' versus 'hats' as often, or like 'bicycle' versus like 'adult bike', 'kids bikes'. You know, to me, those are not as common of uses of search terms. But I could absolutely be wrong on that. It just seems a little inflated to me.",Expectations, Data, Understanding vague,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"It doesn't for us I would say [search volume decision]. Usually we're going to add as many keywords as we can and then when we're thinking about if we're going to keep a keyword, it's going to be after a few weeks and we're seeing how it performs and if it's being clicked on, if it's getting a return, when it's clicked on.

"In this scenario, I would probably leave everything as is for now. But just because the minimum bid that has to be is $1.50 given this keyword. If this keyword [with a 56 cents minimum bid] wasn't here, I might go up to like 65 [cents] or I guess taking out the two highest minimums. I might to up to like 65 [cents] instead of starting at 50 [cents]. Just because these are some more highly searched keywords. Let's say this is just a coffee campaign and all these keywords are relevant to the coffee products, we know that like, there's just a ton of coffee brands on Target. And so we're going to have to be a lot more competitive to keep in the top 5 [SPA] slots.",Bidding, Routine activity, Optimisation, Search terms / Keywords, Relevancy, Products, Target, Placements, SPA (Sponsored Product Ads),,,,,,,,,
"No worries. Yeah, I think something that we often do when we're setting up campaigns is create what we thought had called MVP campaign. And so if this product, lets say we'll stick to the coffee example, we might have one campaign that just has 'coffee' and then in another campaign have 'decaf coffee', 'whole bean coffee'. You know, whatever makes sense as what we would refer to more long tail-keywords. Just because we know that that keyword of coffee is going to be the one that every brand bids on and puts their best products and spends their most because that's what's going to be more likely searched versus like 'dark roast coffee'. And so separating it into it its own group just makes it easier for us to manipulate things like which products are serving and how frequently we want to change the bid. So that's what we've often been doing is like a strategy for initial setup when we know there's going to be, you know 1 to 5 keywords that are going to be extremely competitive for those products.",Campaigns, Routine activity, Products, Search terms / Keywords, Competitor, Bidding, Ad serving, Business strategy, Business challenge,,,,,,,,,
"Yeah. So you would start with a a couple of campaigns, but for the initial setup you would separate the highly searched, highly competitive keywords into its own campaign. And you would still launch the other keywords at the same time. You would just, that one MVP campaign, let's say we have products that the client has on promo or they really want to see more purchases. We could put those products in that campaign. Otherwise we might just launch with every product in that campaign and see which ones are getting the conversions. And then you know, delete the other products. Keep those in the other campaigns where they might be seeing more stronger performance for some long-tail keywords. Because right now it's really hard to.. we don't have reporting in the platform to see what keyword someone searched when they clicked on a product. It's not tied together that way. So we're kind of just making those judges [inferences or assumptions] based on the conversions and click through rates of the product.",Routine activity, Campaigns, Buyer behaviour, Competitor, Search terms / Keywords, Promotions, Sales, Business challenge, Reporting, AdManager, Mental models,,,,,,,
"So then you just have your last page [Review step in AdManager] where you can review your campaign setup. So if we had created this campaign in the AdManager UI, then we would go - let's say this is a new campaign in a program that's already been running since the beginning of the month - but we just got new keywords or new product that we want to add. Then you would go back into Pacvue and add that to the campaign tag to make sure that it's tied together with the wallet. So I think I showed you guys that last time you would go to the tagging section, go to campaign tagging and then you can search by the campaign tag that already exists.

Yes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yes. So we always create the campaign tag first. And then for optimizations, the next piece we'd do, we would set up automatic rules [Optimisation rules in Pacvue]. And this is actually a piece that we are starting to have a new issue with that has just come up. Which is that these rules are running and the action that we're asking them to take is just to increase the CPC. But it's moving the campaigns from active to pending approval. So they're like active and approved. The rule says increase this bid $0.50 and it's being pushed into requiring approval even though the UI doesn't require approval unless you like add a product, add a keyword. So this just started like 2 or 3 weeks ago. It used to not work that way.

And then we also will always copy the CSM that we work with on the Pacvue side so they're aware of any outstanding issues and they can like follow up on tickets and stuff. But they have their own separate like issue flagging and then what happens is they'll just take a look at the ticket. And in this scenario I emailed them, and they said it looks like the issue is coming from the AdManager side. So then I created a Service Now ticket.",Support, Service Now, Pacvue, Managed service, Partners,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"So this is the first process of optimisations. We'll do create an auto rule [in Pacvue]. This one runs based on the wallet tag.

"So this is like it's called a campaign tag but we are using the name of the [AdManager team] wallets to create the tag. So in AdManager you have to select your wallet that something is going to be tied to. But a lot of our brands like Harry’s [male grooming brand] for one, that is the razors that I've been working on. They have like Harry Shampoo, Harry’s razors, Harry shaving cream and they break out their budgets by the different categories. And we have a lot of brands who do things like that. Like Kraft will break it out by like ketchup and Mayo and all their budgets will be in separate buckets based on the product type. So you might have a lot of different wallets that have different products, so you're going to have different rules based on those. So that's why we group things together in Pacvue. So, like right now we have all of these wallets that are live for the Harry’s program, and then we created a matching campaign tag with the wallet name and then tag all the campaigns that are pulling from this wallet, so that they all have the same rule applied.",Tagging, Campaigns, Wallets, Budget, Catalog (retailer), Routine activity, Kraft (Heinz/Kraft), Products, Business decision, Manual effort,,,,,,,,
"No problem. So we do this [campaign tagging in Pacvue] and then we also can do day-parting. This has been really helpful for, I don't think we have anything set up at the moment, but this has been helpful for creating increases in the past. A lot of campaigns like in Q4, we would say like leading up to Black Friday increase the bids and then increase them again like maybe 30% for Black Friday. And you can kind of schedule that in advance so that you don't have to constantly be going in [to Pacvue] and changing all the bids yourself. We haven't used day-parting for anything like not letting programs spend until a certain time of the day because we don't want to do that. We want to make sure that they're live as long as they can be all day. So right now we're really just trying to use it to do things like increase the bids over the weekend or over high shopping, like high traffic times.",Tagging, Pacvue, Day-parting, Seasonal, Optimisation, Bidding, Buyer behaviour,,,,,,,,,,,
"Just business [decision]. Like the sales team just doesn't want to do that. They just want to make sure that we're not giving brands that option and instead saying like if you're not live all day long, then that's a good reason for you to give us more money.",Business decision, Day-parting, Retailers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So you can create day-parting; you can set it to run a specific date range; you can exclude certain dates. It is still in Pacific Standard Time [PST time zone], and then you can choose like for 12.00 AM to 1.00 AM, I want to pause the campaign. Like I said, we're not doing that, but you can't do that. Or I want to set the bid to a certain dollar amount or you can do increase the bid by a certain percent or decrease the bid by either a percent or a dollar value. And then you also have [spend limit] caps. So in case other automation has already increased those campaigns and you don't want them to increase too high, you can set limits on that.",Day-parting, Date or Time related, Time Zones, Ad serving, Budget, Automation, Spend Limits / Cap-outs,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yes. So you can apply it to specific campaigns, or you can apply it to a campaign tag. You have the choice of like choosing individual campaigns or choosing the campaign tag [in Pacvue].

Oh yes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So for this particular wallet, our goal was really just to increase the pacing. So right now the automation that we've been setting was saying increase the CPC. If the campaign has seen sales. So as much as we want to increase the spend we also often have clients who really want to see the return [ROI]. So something that we would do for the rule would say - I'll  click into at the campaign level - we would say looking at the campaigns in the last 5 days. If this campaign stall any sales, then we are comfortable increasing the bid. So if it didn't see any sales then we would not want to create increase the bid. Right now we don't have rules for this particular one set up to decrease the bid, but that is something we've done in the past is create kind of like a balanced rule. So that on one hand we're increasing bids and then on the other hand, we're it decreasing them if the performance starts to fall. So we would kind of set like a pacing rule, increase CPC and then what we were referring to as like a performance rule or like a ROAS based rule to say if this campaign has not seen set any sales in the last week then decrease the bid. But you can set a lot of different requirements around those automations. So you can say if impressions have fallen and they haven't seen sales, then we might actually want to increase the bid, because that likely means that they have started losing impressions because of competition. So really just depends. We can kind of customise the requirements based on what the client is interested in or what the product price point is. If we know that they're in a competitive category like razors that have a lot of different brands running on Target right now, we might just say like always look at impressions. If impressions fall below 1000, a thousand impressions a day increase the bid because the competitions really high. I'm so sorry. I know that's kind of a lot of different scenarios, but we're really trying to tailor based on what the goal is.",Wallets, Pacing, Automation, Pacvue, CPC (Cost Per Click), Spend, Bidding, Optimisation, Performance, ROAS, Impressions, Competitor advantage,,,,,,
"Share of voice is a big one for newer brands at Target. They often have a hard time breaking into like the 3X [times] return, 2X [times] return, when they're a newer brand. So we often try to tell a story of you're getting more share of shelf. You're getting more share of voice. And so in those scenarios, we're trying to improve impressions and click through rate. So we would do things like increase bids for impressions and then right now the algorithm for Target is very heavily, the relevancy is very heavily weighted for click through rate. So we would go back in and review the products and try to see are there products that are getting clicked on a lot in this keyword group that are not getting purchased that we wouldn't be able to automate and Pacvue. But that's just one of the steps that we would take.",Share of Voice, Target, Business challenge, Brands, Share of Shelf, Optimisation, Impressions, CTR (Click Thru Rate), Products, Search terms / Keywords, Pacvue, Automation,,,,,,

"Yes, sometimes because a lot of the brands have direction from Target like in order to keep their products on shelves in Target, they have to meet certain business goals with them. And so they'll have a budget, and they'll say, we don't care what they return it we just need to make sure that we spend this money. So it's not as common as return on Ad spend. That's a much more popular performance metric, but we do have a handful that always or just like, let's make sure that we're delivering the budget in full.",Target, Operations, Brands, In-Store, Business strategy, Spend, ROI, ROAS, Performance, Metrics,,,,,,,,
"So we do have a separate pacing report in DataGrid that we often will look at the pacing report every day to see like here today's pacing report [shared DataGrid pacing report]. I reformatted some of the columns. They're just a little bit different than where they actually live in order, because I'm focusing on campaign data expected to under-deliver their budgets right now. But this is where you would start for spend as the goal to see how much are they expected to under deliver. What is the daily spend that they need to be at and what did they spend yesterday? We also have what did they spend on average over the last seven days, but I find like yesterday it's really helpful in case we made any changes in the last seven days. And then we can say, OK, based on yesterday's spend, this is an accurate assumption that we're getting close to the daily spend needed, but we're not hitting it. And so then in Pacvue we would automate something like anytime impressions fall below, you know, if the average impression for this campaign is 35,000 a day, I might say anytime it falls below that, increase the CPC so that we can try to make up that gap between what we spent yesterday and what we need to spend.",Pacing, Reporting, DataGrid, Manual effort, Campaigns, Data, Performance, Spend, Value or belief, Pacvue, Automation, Expectations, CPC (Cost Per Click), Impressions,,,,
"We could, but I don't have any real setup like that at the moment, just because that's not a scenario that we often run into unfortunately. But there are only 5 Ad slots [for Target], so we often find that we're not competing enough with like Criteo [as Target use a mediation layer to route Ad requests between Criteo and AdManager]. But you can set basically in the [Pacvue] rules you have the option to set decrease CPC for the action taken. So you can say and if impressions remain consistent and that's telling us that we're winning. If we look back every 5 days and our impression's remaining consistent we could say decrease the CPC. That would help improve our ROAS and kind of counterbalance any automatic increases that we're making. And on the actions page [in Pacvue] you you have the option to do budgets.",Target, Placements, Criteo, AdManager, Operations, Pacvue, Automation, Optimisation, Impressions, CPC (Cost Per Click), ROAS, Budget,,,,,,
"We're not using the budget manager [in Pacvue] at the moment just because we have issues going on with like the time zone scenario and also with automation causing campaigns to pause. So we're trying to get some things fixed before we do any sort of budget manager in here, but we do have that option. There is a calendar section where you can set all the budgets at the daily level. You could use the automation for that or you can do increase bid decrease bids that bid or pause campaigns. So if you have the possibility of a campaign performing really poorly and it really negatively impacting the overall ROAS you could pause that particular campaign if it falls below like a certain performance goal. But you could also say decrease the bid. So if we wanted to set up counter rules, I would say if the ROAS is remaining above a certain amount and then I would add if impressions are equal to or greater than what the average that we're seeing for those campaigns, let's say it's like 1000 impressions a day. You could set a couple of different requirements, so if it has a good ROAS and it's meeting its impression goal, let's go ahead and decrease the bid. You can add, I don't know if there's really a limit. You can add a lot of requirements, but the more that you add, the less likely those campaigns are obviously [going] to meet all of them so usually we just have one requirement.",Budget, Pacvue, Errors or Issues, Campaigns, Automation, Loss of revenue, ROAS, Impressions, AdManager,,,,,,,,,
"Not using automation I would say, so there's a couple of pain points and Pacvue like when I was taking you through creating that campaign [in AdManager]. You get to see what those minimum bids are. So at the category level we have floor [minimum] bids and that is sent to us by Target. But we don't have this in Pacvue. There's nowhere to see it, so we would have to go into Target [AdManager instance]. Find what the floor bid is allowed to be and then go back into Pacvue. And so if we wanted to say this is spending a lot of money, but it's not seeing any conversions, let's reset it to the floor [minimum bid level] and then start working our way back up once we figure out what products are the right ones for this campaign or something like that. You have to first come in here [Canpaign setup in AdManager] and find what the floor [minimum] bid is. And it's the same with keywords. So even though we did a bunch of work on the back end [in AdManager] to make sure that we had keywords mapped to the right categories so that we would have the right category floor [minimum bid] tied to them, this information is not in Pacvue. So that's kind of a pain point. So if we were doing something like that where we wanted to go and reduce the CPC as much as we could, we'd probably do that in the [AdManager] UI.",Pain points, Pacvue, Campaigns, Integrations, AdManager, Gap (Product or Service), Search terms / Keywords, Catalog (retailer), CPC (Cost Per Click),,,,,,,,,
"So there's a couple of different thought processes I would say. So one I did earlier today, I didn't go necessarily all the way to the floor [minimum bid level], but in some scenarios I reduced it maybe like $0.10 higher than the floor because the budgets for the wallets were relatively low and they were capping out early in the day, but they didn't have a ton of competition for their categories. So it made sense that they didn't necessarily need to bid super high all day long. And we could reset the bids. We have automatic rules set up for them, so they'll eventually still be increased if they are performing well. So in that scenario, that idea is that the campaign will stay live longer throughout the day and they don't need to be as competitive because they don't have as many brands going up against them for those keywords. And then the other thinking would be trying to work on return on Ad spend. We do a lot of different takes on trying to figure out the how to improve return on Ad spend and usually goes into like digging into the campaign to see if we have the right products tied with the right keywords. But like I was saying, we don't have a report that shows us when somebody searched 'coffee', they clicked on this product. So a lot of it is just us guessing based on looking at the product report and seeing which products they're being purchased. So in that scenario, we might just reduce a good amount of campaigns that are seeing a lot of clicks, they're getting spend, but they're not converting. We'll reduce the CPC and see like if they still get clicks. If is it hurting our spend, like do we need to keep bidding really high just to pace. So it's kind, let's say it's usually not the most strategic approach, but it might be the only thing that's working if we've tried a lot of other scenarios.",Mental models, Bidding, Budget, Wallets, Spend Limits / Cap-outs, Automation, Pacvue, Ad serving, ROAS, Search terms / Keywords, Sales, Products, Business strategy,,,,,
"So the way we would do things is we would set up the Max bid at the start. So in Target we're setting up the bid lower and then increasing gradually throughout the program. But in a second price auction, we could just set the Max bid from the start and then it would only pay, like because of the second price auction it wouldn't pay the Max bid every time. It would only pay if there's actually competition that forces it to increase. So you could set it up as like a $3 CPC and almost just like leave it for the first couple of weeks while you see how it performs. Whereas with Target we would set it up maybe that like $0.50 or a dollar, depending on how many other brands are in the category that we're competing with.

"Right now we don't, because all of the optimizations are being made at the campaign level. So other partners that Pacvue works with like the Amazons and other people they're able to apply tags to keywords and then set automation for keywords. But right now, the way that AdManager is built is everything is grouped within a campaign, so you can't make any sort of automation at the product or keyword level. So for AdManager, these would only work for reporting and then with at that level it's becomes not helpful for us because we would still have to backtrack and figure out what campaign that product or keyword lives in to use the data to actually make any changes.",Optimisation, Pacvue, Tagging, Amazon, Search terms / Keywords, AdManager, Limitation, Campaigns, Products, Data,,,,,,,,
Would keyword or product tagging be useful?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I can't really think of a scenario where it would be useful just because, right now we're grouping keywords together at the campaign level. If we were to just like, I think the idea of said by search term was to eliminate the need for carving out so many individual campaigns. But we still have to do that for any time we go into like a specific keyword. Like 'chocolate ice cream' can't be in the same campaign as 'vanilla ice cream'. So we still find ourselves creating multiple campaigns all the time.

"I think some of the bulk operations that are really helpful for the most part is the ability to bulk add products. That is really cool. And then obviously the changing of dates, we don't have that in the past in the AdManager platform. So we would have to go edit at each individual campaign, change the date and then go through every step of this before you finish that one date change edit. So I'll just click through the four different pages [steps in Campaign setup in AdManager] and now I have to go edit the next one. So it's really handy to be able to just do that in bulk in Pacvue. You can just change the date here [using quick edit on the Campaign dashboard in Pacvue]. And then you can also do the add products. So sometimes we'll have clients changing products out seasonally or they'll launch new products, and they'll send us a list that we can now add new products to their campaign. And we like to do that as quickly as possible because it often helps us increase the spend. So here we could just grab if there's a category, a keyword and PDP and we can add the product to all three. We could just do that quickly here versus going again line by line edit [in AdManager], click through all 6 pages upload. So that is a little bit, I would say time consuming [in AdManager].

"This view is quite old, but still when I want to add an integration with one of the publishers accounts, we have a support for many of them, like Amazon, Apple. Your namespace, each AdManager namespace, we have a separate channel type in our platform like Ahold Delhaize or Albertsons or Macy's, Nectar 360. All this kind of namespaces, we separate them in this way. And when I select one of the by AdManager publishers you can just name it somehow, team ID. That's the AdManager team ID and the API key taken from the user settings in the AdManager UI. And like everything is entered here, I'm being authorized retrieving the tokens. If all is good, I'm persisting the account, and I can see them later on in the list of the accounts integrated.",Access, Apple, Ahold Delhaize, Macy's, Publishers, UPC or Identifier, API, Nectar360, Integrations, Namespace (retailer setup), Albertsons, Amazon, AdManager,,,,,
"That's the like... 'How do we add a team, a AdManager team to a channel account in Skai'. And after that you can drill down into campaigns grid, and this is where you can see all the campaigns belonging to your team. And if you want to download from publisher [from Action menus in Skai]. Like this is what happens after you integrated with an API. So there are two options. [1] You can wait for the auto download to happen nightly, or [2] you can go ahead and manually download you select the account, you select the statuses of the campaigns. And then in the list you will be able to see the campaigns available in this team and download into Skai.",Campaigns, Data, Integrations, API, Skai (Kenshoo), Publishers, Access, AdManager,,,,,,,,,,
"And that's what was the main pain point, by the way, for us. In AdManager, a campaign is a single object like you, you have a campaign and then in the campaign you can see also all the Ads, the keywords is targeting option. All this kind of stuff. However, most of the publishers we worked with, they usually split entities by levels. Like you can have a campaign entity, an add entity, a keyword entity as separate entities and this is how we actually build our platform also. Our data model, how it is built. We have campaigns, Ad groups or Ad sets, depends on the publisher terminology. We have Ads, we have targeting product keywords, negative keywords, different levels.",Language use / Terminology, Complexity, Spend, Data challenge, Products, AdManager, Publishers, Ad Types, Search terms / Keywords, Pain points, Campaigns,,,,,,,
"And because our flows are usually built on the entity segregation like we do not mix them, for AdManager we  needed to develop a new flow that during the download we'll split the entity into several entities. Like we have campaign, we split it. First of all, we have to create a dummy Ad group entity to confirm the hierarchy of entities. And then under this dummy Ad group we have your keywords, if there are any keywords. And we have Ads that advertised products are mapped to. It's actually a product ID. We also fetch product titles and product images from the BigQuery because they are not supplied by the campaign API.",Products, Complexity, API, BigQuery, Integrations, Skai (Kenshoo), Hack or Workaround, Campaigns, Data, Search terms / Keywords, UPC or Identifier,,,,,,,
"In the campaign API, we only receive the IDs of the products to be advertised, right. But we want to show something to our clients. At least the thumbnail, like the title, the product.

"OK. And on top of that, we have like this is how the campaign API integrated. We can see the campaigns in different grids. We can see products as Ads and then on top of all this entities we can use all the functionality we have in Skai platform. Like we have different automated actions, different optimisations flow, day-partying, different stuff.",Campaigns, Automation, Products, Skai (Kenshoo), Integrations, Ad Types, Competitor advantage, Day-parting, API,,,,,,,,,
It is also worth to mention that in the API actually works with catalogs and placements as ID's. Like these are UI D’s that some and they are hard coded because there is no way for us (there is no API) to go and fetch available placements or available catalogs. And that's another pain point that I listed. I can share it later on with you in this list.,Placements, Data challenge, API, Pain points, Catalog (retailer),,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And then because we as you know, as an Omni channel platform, we have integration with different publishers and we cannot afford having, for example, if you are talking about placements, different publisher can have different placements, different names, etcetera, etcetera. We want to unify them so that the client will have a single user experience. And then, for example, [if] I'm adding a placement column in the grid for different publishers, I would like to see something very similar, because usually it's very similar things. So during the download, when we have a UID of the placement, we convert it to something that is readable that we can show to the client. For example, 'Search in Grid' [SPA] or 'Category' or something else, broad display. And then during the upload we do the opposite conversion like we have this 'Search in Grid'. So this is how we save it in database we save it as an enum value and then during the upload we know that we are uploading a campaign from US Grocery Network and the placement enum value is 'search in grid'. We need to map it to this UID and send it as part of the campaign object to the API. So this double conversion like during download, we convert it to enum. During the upload we convert it back to UID and same goes to catalogs like, it's the same. Catalogs are being, if I'm not mistaken, it's a retailer column on our side. Like Piggly Wiggly or Petco? Same thing, like API works with the UID. That's OK. But the problem is that this missing API that would tell us for this namespace we have this list of catalogs, these are their names, these are their IDs, et cetera. That would be easier for us to maintain, because once a new catalog or once a new placement appears, we need to go to the hard-coded list at the new item there and then redeploy the production to make it happen for the clients.",Publishers, Placements, Operations, Campaigns, UPC or Identifier, Gap (Product or Service), API, SPA (Sponsored Product Ads), Business challenge, Piggly Wiggly, Manual effort, Namespace (retailer setup), Grocery Network / Grocery One, Skai (Kenshoo), Catalog (retailer),,,
"Yeah. So that's, that's about it, and then the rest of of it. For some reason by the way, I cannot access the [API] specs. I had the link the developers AdManager. com to product campaign but for some reason I'm getting the 'page not found' error. Not sure why, previously it worked. And I just wanted to go through the other fields, but mostly when we look at the campaign object field in the API we support mostly everything. We do not support, for sure, our custom questions. It's a bummer I cannot see the campaign entity now [shared screen with 'Page not found' error]. But most of the fields are supported in Skai. Like mostly... I don't know 90% integrated with the fields available in the campaign that are mandatory for sure and optional fields are mostly also integrated in Skai. So that's how it looks like in our platform.

"OK. I tend to say I tend to say that I would prefer the list API. Like that I can get for a namespace full list of available catalogs and placements. However, even the second option is also good.

But I can think that both should work.",Positive feedback, API, Namespace (retailer setup), Catalog (retailer), Placements,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"No, I don't think there are any gaps. Like I didn't heard anything about that. I yesterday checked with a product manager that leads this integration and she doesn't have anything to add also. So if we can transition this to the API, great. That's always good.",API, FOLLOW-UP,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ok, let me see if I have anything else. So, first of all, getting to the to the starting point, I would like to say to thank you because the API behaves according to the specs. This is something that is very important because we have experience with other publishers that it's not the case, so that's a very good point. However, I still don't understand why it's not working for me now [i.e. seeing a 'Page not found error' when trying to access the API specs], but in general it works according to what is described in this specification.",Publishers, AdManager, API, Positive feedback,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Alright, no problem. So second point was, from my end, was about the campaign as a single entity. I already talked about it, so I highlight here about the new upload flow. And also it's another point to mention, because we have keywords and Ads as different entities and each entity has the internal Skai ID and also the channel ID, like ID in Target, the ID in AdManager. Because we don't have such in the AdManager like we receive a product or keyword, they don't have IDs. So we had to generate these ID's, the channel ID's by ourselves.",AdManager, Ad Types, Data challenge, Products, UPC or Identifier, Hack or Workaround, Integrations, Complexity, API, Search terms / Keywords, Skai (Kenshoo),,,,,,,
"So usually it is used during the download because you need to know you already have such an entity in the campaign. And when you need to merge the entity that you already have downloaded with the changes of the entity that it's coming from the publisher, you usually compare by the IDs. And also we need channel ID's because when we fetch performance data we need to know how to connect the performance for a specific keyword within this campaign to this specific keyword that we got from the campaign API. I have for example, in some of the campaign I have a keyword, I don't know 'paper' and I need to know how to connect this 'paper' to its performance coming from BigQuery. So in BigQuery when we fetch data from BigQuery, we also need to know how to... OK I have a performance [metric] for [a] keyword but you know it's very common like we need to connect it to some something. So we take very easy example, like we take the keyboard itself, we take the keyword match type. I know that match type is exact for all the namespaces except goPuff. So we take these two, connect with the underscore, and take the MD5 hash and this is my generated ID. So to this generated ID I already connected the BigQuery performance. And then the same ID is generated during the campaign download via API and then I have this structure, this performance, and I know that these are the ID's, and I can connect them together and show here in the grid [Campaign grid in Skai] the performance, by keyword. Same goes to add as well.",Integrations, UPC or Identifier, Skai (Kenshoo), Data, BigQuery, Performance, API, Search terms / Keywords, Campaigns,,,,,,,,,
"That's the purpose. And also, another API, we talked about catalogs in placements. Maybe it's not an API because it's really changed anyway. I think the last namespace we've added support for was Nectar360, and it's actually European namespace with the Pounds [Sterling] as a currency. And we also have this time zone and currency hard coded. So we have a namespace enum internally, like we describe the namespace, this part in the URL, like 'app' for US grocery Network. But it was app.com and then we have like Petco, Macy's and Nectar360. So this is hard-coded. And we also have hard-coded time zone and don't remember we actually use it. But the currency, we had issues with the conversion because there were some small discrepancies in this area. So we just figure it out later on that it should be a different currency, but because by default it's USD and then here is GPP. So again, not sure it's a worth in investing on your end, like developing something. like any new API, or something. But just mentioning here that we had this issue. Maybe we could have some very, very naive API on a namespace level to say OK, that's my namespace, US grocery Network, that's my namespace identifier to be used in the URL. This is my currency, and this is my time zone or some other metadata that probably will be required or already required during the communication with the API. But again it's up to you guys. We don't really see a lot of lot of issues here, just something that we had recently. All right, so catalogs and placement already talked about it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So Wallet API was missing and it is already working now. But we didn't get to integrate it. And actually because it was missing in the first place, we didn't support the creation of the items of the campaigns in Skai, because Wallet ID is a mandatory field while creating the campaign. And we could allow clients [to] create this. So we have several ways to create campaigns or other entities in Skai. For some of the publishers we have creation flows, like Wizard when you create like a regular wizard. Or for some of them we have functionality to create them with bulk import where you supply the CSV file or an XML file with fields for campaign creation and the process will create such. Because the wallet ID is again it's a UID that a client needs to find it somewhere, it's not visible if I'm not mistaken. Nowhere in the AdManager UI *. The client doesn't have a way to know this wallet ID, so we couldn't actually allow creation because they don't have it.",Publishers, Skai (Kenshoo), Integrations, Wallets, UPC or Identifier,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It's a different story now because we already have such API. We can already fetch Wallet IDs via API and so somewhere in the platform to the client. But the priorities have changed a bit and we are now working on different stuff than rather than adding support for all the API. But, that's another item.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And the last item here in the list. Again, it's not something very critical. I would say it's not critical at all, but in the testing environment they have their own catalog and placement IDs. And again, because we map the ID's to enum values and sometimes the same enum value, I don't know, 'Search in Grid' but in the same namespace but in different environments they have different ID's. We had to know that, OK so for this environment, this UID means 'Search in Grid' and for this [other enviroment] it means [a] different UID again means the same search ID. And we had to introduce a small distinction between the environments whether we are working in the production environments or I'm testing my changes in labs. I need to know where I'm currently doing the upload, to know how exactly to map this enum value to a proper ID so that API will accept it. Not crucial at all, but something we had to deal with. Maybe if we would have this API it would be easier for us, I don't know, worth mentioning. And that's pretty much it I think from my end. I asked [the] product owner Casey whether she has anything to add from the field. Maybe some gaps in the product and she only mentioned something related to the performance data to the BigQuery solution that I think is out of scope here. For the campaign API there are no more questions from our end.",Publishers, Limitation, Products, Ad Types, UPC or Identifier, Integrations, Skai (Kenshoo),,,,,,,,,,,
Do you mean if I want to... ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yeah. So that's the problem. We don't allow [clients] to do. We don't have creation of the campaigns because we didn't implement it from the beginning and we didn't get to it afterwards. After the Wallet API was introduced so that we could have this wallet ID. So we have never implemented the creation [of campaigns]. All we can do is to download the campaign, make changes, I don't know, make budget changes, bid changes, add keywords, and upload back to AdManager. So if I want to add 'paper' as a keyword or I want to add a new advertised product, all I do is actually I list in the in the bulk sheet [spreadsheet]. I just specify that this is a keyword. And because we generate IDs by our own [platform], for us it's not a problem. We have 'paper', we know that the keyword match type is always exact and then we can generate the channel ID, like our own dynamic channel ID. And during the upload flow we know that for this campaign these keywords are connected. We take only the keyword, the phrase, and put it in the API. Same goes to products. We take only the product ID. Or ASIN [Amazon UPC code], call it whatever you want.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yeah, exactly. That's actually a product mapped to because we also have products here. There is a dedicated grid. But it's kind of different. It's really different. I think it's products fetched by something that is not within a campaign. Seems like to me, I actually don't know much about this grid, but it's not campaign products. Like it's all products within a channel or something that we can fetch and show here while. Usually when we download a campaign and is supplied to most of the publishers, the structure is exactly these. Like you have campaign, you have Ad set or Ad group and then you have Ads. But since we don't have Ads here and we have products, that was a [business] decision. OK, let's map the product ID because here in Ad you usually have product ID. Actually, there are publishers where we can have more than one [product ID]. And product image and product other stuff. So it was natural to map product ID to an Ad. If a product ID appears in the list of advertised products in the campaign, they actually means that it is active, in an active status. We can also pause or delete, actually from here [Ads listing in Skai] and it will just remove Ad or product from the list of advertised products. This is how we can manipulate with adding or removing products for a campaign. We play with a status for the Ad and then during the upload we take all active [statuses] should be included; all deleted [statuses] should be removed from the list. And this is how we can add or remove products. And same goes again to keywords like they behave very very similar.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So in other channels there are Ad group. Are you asking in other channels there are such entities like Ad groups or Ad sets?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So again, if Ad group here for AdManager it's completely dummy entity and we just need it to to connect because we cannot. The data model is built in that way that Ads are connected to the Ad group. You cannot connect it directly to campaign. That's the main reason why we have Ad group here. And the channel ID for the Ad group is actually the same as for the campaign. If I'm not mistaken, we just take the campaign UID and put as channel ID for the Ad group. I think they should be. Well, I'm not sure because maybe, that's because this is a CS demo and we have never uploaded. That's created by, you know that's a hacky solution in the demo environment. We didn't really create them. It's just for demo purposes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yeah. Again that's probably not for sure it's not the question to me, I don't really know how.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As an end user, yes. So as an end user like. Let me know if you can still hear me. OK. Yeah. For the end user where you when you want to log into the platform, you will have to, you know, log me in. So first of all, they will have their own user registered in the platform. They log in and then each user has a a list of assigned profiles. That's because I was in the Ad groups grid [whne previously sharing Skai demo]. Actually, he gets to the last grid he was in before.  And then if they need to assign a new or integrate with the new Channel account they just select this profile they want to do, to do so. Or add new profile, go to settings [Profiel Settings section in Skai] and this is the place they can integrate any of the channels available in Skai. Does that answer your question?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Or maybe I get it got it wrong.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"No. They have their own keys. I'm not really sure how onboarding happens like there are some steps to be taken. And then I think as part of these steps, there is an explanation of how a user that wants to integrate the channel, a team in AdManager, a [AdManager] team into Skai, there is a guide where to go in AdManager platform, take the API user key and go back to Skai and put it here. But whether this is available to any end user or there are persons with that permission only, I don't really know.",Access, On-boarding, Brands, Understanding vague,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Yeah, in New York?.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yeah, she was to join. We couldn't find the link and she said OK, I have to move on and then go back and go to the office, so probably she will follow up. But yeah, any questions that we will still need to clarify, we can have another session, or another, or we can take it by emails, don't really care.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yeah. Certainly we can. We can assess this effort.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So I think it's about having the least of ID's and then, you know, we could have a campaign endpoint that would return you just the campaign object with an ID's of the Ads, for example. And then we will have an Ad endpoint providing with an ID would return you information about the Ad.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Well, actually, if we are looking at the keyword in general, right? So we have the keyword as an entity. So we can see that actually there is not much to add as any fields like when I'm looking at the attributes right we have keyword itself, like a phrase. We have a match type we know always exact for AdManager; publisher, we know it; the status, either it's included or not, like the bid; and then nothing else. Like actually for the keyword, it's already internal... all this internal. Yeah, for the bid, you know, we don't really need anything else.

"We recently had, well actually, we held this day-parting functionality in Skai where you can kind of automated actions where you can say... Let me see if I can demonstrate it here. Maybe I need to drill down into this into the profil, just a moment. I'm not sure where this here in the UI, but we have a functionality of a day-parting where you can say OK for every Monday on 9.00 AM in the morning increase my bid for 10% and in the evening 6.00 PM, decrease it back. And you can select these rules for each of the days in the week and there will be a process running and increasing, [and] decreasing. So on our end, it was like this day-parting functionality available for other publishers and there was another team that enabled it for AdManager. Didn't test it well and clients in production saw it doesn't work. So literally on the last week, we fixed that and now it should work. So, we are integrated with bidding, keyword bidding.",Skai (Kenshoo), Day-parting, Automation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"No. Actually we are, if a bid that is lower than minimum is supplied, the API will return an error and the client will see it in [campaign] grid. There is a failure reason.

That it didn't feel like this is the very generic statement that the API was designed to be scripted against. It felt like it was really designed to have a user interface in front of it. So like specific values would need to be entered and specific things would need to be known.,Scaling, Business challenge, API,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So the scripting, it is hard because with the script, what we aimed to do is provide Ad Operations with a templated file that they could fill out and then that file could just be taken and uploaded. But when we started to navigate some of the values in the UI, we felt like it became almost difficult without a lot of prompts. And I think that's where like a user interface is helpful when using the API is that it gives you a lot of prompts. It provides you a lot of values that you just need to know to actually start using the API. So I don't know how, I think that's a good kind of overview. I know Kevin, how you felt, I know we did some work on it together but like just an example, like the search terms for products was kind of like a weird one. Like you had to add a search term, every individual product needed to be associated with the search term. You needed a catalog associated with every single product you entered. Like it didn't make a lot of sense to have to individually enter that and have that value when you were adding each individual product. Like it doesn't make sense in the UI to do that where you have to select a catalog for each product or a search term for each particular product. So that's one of the biggest things we noticed is that you couldn't like logically build out the steps if you were trying to template it in a particular document or a file. It felt very much like you almost have to have a user interface because you needed to prompt for values. And also there's so much repetition. So catalog ID, obviously, you know, for the majority of our interactions, it's going to be the same value. The search terms, you could use the same search term for multiple products. [But] in the API you can't do it like that.",Scaling, Managed service, Catalog (retailer), Business challenge,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I guess just from our view, the API integrators are kind of building their own new UI's in front of the API. Right. So they're kind of like taking a lot of the work away from whatever you're trying to do. But we don't want to build a whole UI for the Ad Operations team. We want to give them something that's like easy, like a template. Like you could, we could almost design a CSV file or something to that effect. Yeah, OK. Don't go too crazy... Google sheets are good. But we want to give them something that's kind of like easy, simple to fill out and allows them to like easily, even if you could like download from the platform and upload into a CSV. And then you could just push that into the platform somewhere and it will take that and it will like call the API for you. So you're doing things in bulk rather than kind of like this individual, the method we have now where you individually go in and you make individual adjustments to every single campaign. You know, you're not far away from the using the UI.",Partners, Excel, Google spreadsheet, API, Managed service, Campaigns, Bulk actions,,,,,,,,,,,
"I think either way bulk operations in the platform aren't something that's really considered. Like there's whether you're using Pacvue or whether you're using a script, there's no kind of bulk operation that occurs.",Bulk actions, Pacvue,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Everything kind of just happens like one by one, regardless. And if that's the nature of the API, that's OK. But I think the direction we need to move in is how do we expand the API so that bulk operations become something that you can do quite easily. And there's like a easily defined definition. I want to update 50 campaigns. I don't want to loop through 50 individual campaigns and update them all. How can I build a way to make these updates more feasible. Or how can I build a way that, I don't know if you change the way that campaigns are structured? I know Caroline, you mentioned like the way that campaigns are structured right now is very like individual placement. This, that, so on. It doesn't really lend into like a bulk update style approach.",API, Categories, AdManager, Limitation, Bulk actions, Reduce effort,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Like, how do I kind of go through and make changes to multiple campaigns very easily. You can't do it. And I think the way that the API has been designed doesn't allow us to do that flexibly. I think it kind of follows that bold kind of pattern of like you have to do everything individually because the UI does everything individually, right? Like there's no kind of different approach or different take. Like I like the API, it's great that we have an API to be able to build things against. But I think the mentality is probably where we need to start adjusting if we want to step in the direction of like bulk operations. And bulk operations, I think is what we're really talking about here when it comes to like reducing the cost.",API, UI, Bulk actions, AdManager,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yeah, I think a lot of it again, it comes down to like the assumptions that the platform makes on your behalf and the prefill of values that the platform makes on your behalf.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And then how very specific you have to be when you're using the API. Like there's a lot of things that can be inferred. I think we mentioned a couple before and we can revisit the script and see where it was difficult if you'd like to.,API,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But again, like catalog ID. It could just send a catalog ID for everything. Why would you need to set it for every individual product? And why would you need to include that in every single thing that you add? It is not going to make a lot of sense.",UPC or Identifier, Reduce effort, Catalog (retailer),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And in the platform, you don't have to do it because you have a user interface that infers that for you, right? You click the catalog ID, you add products. It's kind of inferred. This other methodology again, seems to miss that portion when it comes to the API.",AdManager, UPC or Identifier, Gap (Product or Service), API, Catalog (retailer),,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yeah, I think it's again, the biggest challenge we run into is how very prescriptive you have to be. Like, it feels like you need to be very prescriptive with all the values that you enter. And there's not kind of like assumptions that the API makes on your behalf. Which it probably could like it does in the UI more or less. Just because if you enter the team name, you can make some assumptions. If you enter the one catalog ID, you can make some assumptions that all the products are there. Currently it doesn't let you do that. So again, like we can revisit the script. We can kind of revisit some of the different things that we run into like placement ID instead of placement name and a few different things like that kind of require that internal knowledge. And I think also where the aggregators have to work with us very heavily to understand certain things. Like the aggregators, we can't really, we couldn't set them loose in the API by themselves.

"It's more like why would you select the ID instead of the name? Like why wouldn't you just put the placement name in there? It represents the ID anyway and that's maybe just honing in on the wrong thing. Like the placement ID is hidden in the UI, whereas the name is exposed. But in the API, there's no way you can find the placement ID. You have to know it from our side. Not even in that. If you're in the retail team, could you understand the placement ID? So you actually can't use the API unless you know the placement ID, which means you do have to reach out to someone on our side to understand placement ID's in your own platform.",Placements, API, UPC or Identifier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Yeah. The other one, I think Kevin that came up quite a lot was like error handling. So like if you have bids for search term and you put a wrong bid in, you don't know what it is. If you put a category bid under the minimum, the platform doesn't tell you what it is. So like you can't actually handle errors in your script. It will just kind of kill it more or less and then you have to reach out and understand. So like information in is one thing when we were looking at. But then also information back out. How do you handle errors? How do you kind of prompt after the fact. How do you know the information you're putting in is correct without having to navigate away from the API to get that? Like is there a way to kind of say like, OK, you're below the Min bid with this. Update the value. You're below, the min bid is this. Update this value. And I think when we add features, sometimes we, we don't change our API responses. I could be wrong, but there's a lot of different things that you can enter into the API right now and you just won't be able to like, understand what went wrong.",Understanding vague, Categories, Errors or Issues, API, Bidding, UI improvements, Guidance,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yeah, exactly. And I think that just kind of ties into like, if you want to build tools against this, you need that good error handling because you want to build in redundancies to the whatever tool you're creating. You want to be able to throw an error that you can understand, interpret and then handle. But right now, you know, [it's] just wrong.",API, Guidance, Errors or Issues,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kevin did you have anything to add?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I think the only other one is like, I know it's coming but we should try to like, match whatever we're able to do in the UI we can do via the API and then right now we have product Ads and banners. So it's like, well, is half your capabilities here and the rest jump in the UI and do it there. If we want to start with, even if it's not exposed and it's just bulk operations through whatever mechanism and Ian you mentioned like a file upload or something like that, even if it's a templated file. Like how do we go about doing that? How do we create like a templated file that someone could go in export their campaigns and then they could just edit the values like you know. That saves you from building like a nice pretty user interface where you can edit all the values and just gives you a mechanism to kind of use tools to edit bulk like a bunch of campaigns. And you know, that might be the end goal. But I think it's a good approach to kind of allowing someone to come into a platform or a team download all the campaigns. Type in the values that they want at certain things. Re-uploaded in the same kind of area and then it goes away and processes those updates on campaigns.",API, Banners, SPA (Sponsored Product Ads), Bulk actions, UI,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yeah, I think like even parity right now would be a good first step. I know we're keen on bulk but like we can. If there's ways to navigate bulk right now or if there's no way to navigate, which means you do have to switch between the two, regardless. I think the only call out on banners is like, how do we, I know there's probably more one’s for you. But because there is some portion where you are uploading an image, we don't have an image repository that we picked from until it's uploaded. And then I guess it just sits in cloud front.

"I think that makes sense and Katy we probably have this almost ready. When I pulled the numbers recently. Yeah, I thought it was really helpful for me to dimension-ise these things. For SPA, because that's where API is involved today, around 50% of our revenue is managed. That means our team has to do it. And today we have to use Pacvue because it drives the automation we need. The other 50% largely also come through API partners. There's only a very small fraction that actually use our UI today. And I think it all centers around this piece of it's just hard to use and it's very manual, right?",Pacvue, SPA (Sponsored Product Ads), API, Partners,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And, I think the added layer of the API is more and more clients want a programmatic approach to RMN. They want to be able to buy across multiple retailers in one UI. Which we kind of do [want] too.

"Paired up with the operations team and asked them, what are the super high-volume tasks that you have to do all the time? Because currently - I'm sharing my screen, sorry if this is a little big, but anyway it kind of show it together. It's currently if you want to do a bulk operation or duplicate campaigns [within AdManager] under a new wallet, or do things like that, you have to spend a lot of time clicking through the admin. So find an operations person and I want to create a new campaign or duplicate a campaign. I have to do everything, right. I have to come in. I have to pace things there. Then I have to select every value here [in Campaign Manger within AdManager] and kind of do every single thing, right. I have to look up all my product codes that I need. Some of them are going to be fine. Other ones are going to be like... harder to find. You come in and set your CPC [Cost Per Click] if you need them and OK then you launch your campaign.",Manual effort, Managed service, Reduce effort, Products, CPC (Cost Per Click), API, Bulk actions, UPC or Identifier,,,,,,,,,,
"And if you have to do that all the time while kind of checking between two sources of information and also like checking the campaign you're working on. Or adjusting, you know if you have to do 5 [campaigns], it's probably OK. If you have to do 100, you're spending a little time clicking around in an admin, or in the UI, which probably isn't the best use of time. We see the same thing when you're editing a campaign. So if I want to edit this campaign. You can't get to any stage that I want to get to without doing that [having to go through each campaign setup step]. I just want to change the CPC, you know, have to kind of click four times to get here [in the Campaign Manger setup] and then adjust. It doesn't seem like much, but again, if you're doing one, it's probably OK. If you're doing 100 like why, you know. I can never go forward. I can't ever skip a step [in Campaign Manager].",Campaigns, Manual effort, Data challenge, Frustration, Bulk actions,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So, what we're looking for is ways to automate and allow for a bulk update of campaigns so we can reduce the overhead or the requirement of someone to come in here, find every single campaign they want, under whatever team they want. You know, again, like if you're thinking about different teams, you have to be in that particular team to edit campaigns for that team. So again, you're spending a lot of time in the UI just clicking around, finding the things that you want all the time. Which is, in a large scale takes up a lot of time.",Customer needs, Campaigns, Reduce effort, Automation, Managed service, Bulk actions,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So, what we started doing was we first started looking at how we can get information out of the platform. Now you can't really get campaign information out of the platform. It doesn't really like. There's no campaign report, right? So there's no report where you can come in this platform and download it and get information about your campaign. The only campaign report you have is  how your campaign is performing. This is purely for advertisers. I'm sure it's for operations people too, but probably they're not going to use it. They're going to use DataGrid. So reporting is like the first thing [to address].",Data, Gap (Product or Service), Limitation, DataGrid, AdManager, Campaigns, Managed service, Aggregated reporting, Data challenge,,,,,,,,,
"How do you get information out of the platform so you can see all your campaigns? How do you even download your campaigns? OK, you can't. You can't come in here and download all these campaigns, right? And then understand them all. You have to go through each individual one if you know the exact names of the campaign. If you know the team you're in, and so on and so forth. So again, you're spending a lot of time like looking for information that should probably be more readily available to you.",Limitation, Manual effort, AdManager, Frustration, Campaigns,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So the first step was to design like an export [through BigQuery] of campaign information from the platform that is used in the API and is also modified quite commonly. So we built this query with the operations team to essentially download campaigns in a report that has the kind of things they want. Obviously, we kind of limit it to product only because that's the only thing we can work with. And this is the kind of thing they're looking for, right? You have the namespace. Actually I don't know that we know that. But if you're thinking more in your global scale and like how to modify multiple campaigns across multiple retailers, which we can touch on a little bit as planning the script, then OK, like now you need to start thinking about what the namespace does that exist in case I want to touch multiple namespaces, right? This is great for one namespace, but let's scale it out. Operations works on multiple namespaces all the time. Running it to one for the tests that we're doing, but there is always the opportunity to kind of expand that out and look at multiple namespaces. I think it's a better way to do it.",BigQuery, Understanding vague, API, Limitation, Managed service, AdManager, Namespace (retailer setup), Bulk actions, Aggregated reporting,,,,,,,,,
"Being able to touch multiple campaigns across multiple namespaces from one place, massive help. This is the campaign ID, again [in BigQuery]. Probably not something that you're fully aware of. Maybe you are if you covered it out after you've created the campaign. But the campaign name is and they're generally created with like a certain format in mind. In production and staging here, where we're doing our testing, it's less important. Next thing in the team ID which you know no one really knows what that means. So we're going to put the team name in here as well. But the [team] ID has to be used and the API call here. So you have to take the ID and pass it in. So we need it and you'll see why in a second. Placement ID, and I don't think you can get this information. This is hard to find, but you need it as well for the API calls that we pull it in. Display name as well, you get it from the UI. But again, not very helpful to you here because you need the placement ID.",Poor performance, UPC or Identifier, Frustration, Namespace (retailer setup), Placements, API, Campaigns, BigQuery,,,,,,,,,,
"So I'll pause here. Just to kind of clarify, like I'm thinking about this from 2 angles. One is net new campaign creation where you have to fill information in that you that the API currently requires. And [2] modification of existing campaigns where potentially we can pull the information down for you, or you can pull the information that yourself. In a perfect world, this wouldn't be a report that comes out of BigQuery, it should be a report that comes out of the platform or some mechanism. Some tool where you could download it, look at your existing campaign, make adjustments to it and then push it back up [to AdManager]. Which is essentially the process that we're currently doing. We're just taking the download, we're processing it to a team, they're making modifications and we're just pushing it back up through the avenues that we have currently. Again, it's not ideal, but we're kind of working with what we have. I'm sure in like a future concept, like once we have an API that can kind of do these kind of bulk operational things, it's probably easier to just build something in the UI that allows you to go through a list and make modifications, and multiple things. And if you worked with like Pacvue and things like that, you'll know their UI kind of has like a grid and you could come in and make modifications.",BigQuery, Limitation, Competitor advantage, Campaigns, Pacvue, API, Customer needs, Bulk actions,,,,,,,,,,

"Not necessarily with the same product code, but that's a bit of a different story. That's that's a bit more along the lines of like universal product codes [UPC] and things like that. Because the same product that's across two different retailers is two different things, right? That code might mean Pepsi here, but it might mean Coke somewhere else. Terrible example, but you can kind of get it. So looking for like UPC codes or common names or things like that so they can identify.

"Wallet needs is another one [in BigQuery]. So like wallet name. I mean no one really knows the wallet ID. You have to be on the platform to get it out.

That might be one to think about whether you can use different values or list them all somehow. But anyway, we digress there. The ID is fine, they can create them in the UI and pull the values and if they need to create new campaigns.",Wallets, BigQuery, API, Customer needs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Kellogg products is, I think, a tricky one when we talk about multi catalog. This is something I think I'll run through and script.

But as it does exist, multiple product codes can exist in multiple catalogs. Which can be a little bit hairy here. And you can have multiple.

"It gets pretty easy from here out [in BigQuery]. These are pretty straightforward. I think the only thing that's missing here is like bids by search term. You can do it in the API, but you can't get it out of BQ [BigQuery], so you don't know the bid per search term as it's associated in the platform. Currently, I don't think you can retrieve it via the API. At least API that we have the exposed one. I'm sure you could get it from an internal one but can't really use those.",API, BigQuery, Limitation, Search terms / Keywords, Bidding,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"So we can create them and we can probably retrieve them if we were going to build something specific for one campaign, but I can't get them out of BQ [BigQuery]. I can't get bids for the specific search term or get search terms. I can get Max cost per click but I can't get search terms and bids out of BQ [BigQuery]. That's where we're like, if we're generating report out of BQ to be adjusted and maybe this isn't the ideal way to do it. But I think this is the best way that we have currently without like calling the endpoint for all the campaigns and like building kind of a JSON thing and having them adjust that. Or taking the JSON and converting it into an Excel file. This is where we kind of come to to get the full list of information about all the active campaigns in the platform. So we can give them a report that they can easily understand and adjust.",Campaigns, BigQuery, Excel, Manual effort, API, Reporting, Search terms / Keywords, Bidding,,,,,,,,,,
"So what we do is we generate this report [in BigQuery] and it looks something like this [in an Excel export]. You can see I have the values in here and what I'm doing with the script is essentially I am going through every row, understanding if there's a campaign ID or not to decide whether or not we want to create or update a campaign.

It's going OK.",BigQuery, Excel, Manual effort, Campaigns, API, Reporting, Search terms / Keywords, Bidding,,,,,,,,,,
"There's some error handling that's a little interesting. Dieter, we talked about one today. I don't know why you sometimes get that error and sometimes you don't. But we'll step through the script and like some of the things that have become difficult. Now the first one is user key per environment. So like if you want to get an access token to use API V3 [AdManager Campaign API], you have to get an access token for the specific namespace you're in. Even if you're on the same project. So each time you want to create a campaign for update a campaign for a specific environment, you have to go and get an access token directly from that environment. So the only way I think you can do that is to go away and kind of store all the tokens you need for the day for the script for to run, and then just pop in the tokens as you can after a new namespace.",Errors or Issues, API, Business challenge, Namespace (retailer setup), Manual effort,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I think it would be better to have like an API key that you can use like even if it's from the retailer team that allows you to create campaigns on behalf of teams. I don't know why you wouldn't have that because in the UI, if you're in the retailer team, you can add yourself to a supplier team and create a campaign on their behalf anyway. There's nothing they can do [retailers] that stops you from doing that. So it's interesting to see like why you need to... have access to the namespace and the user in the team to create a campaign on their behalf when you can kind of do it anyway, if you really want to. I guess it protects you from not being able to like create campaigns by accident for a team that you're not a part of. But I think if you're part of the retailer team as a user, then you should probably get some sort of override there. So it can be assumed that your token has access to create campaigns on behalf of all teams or something like that. Because you can create fixed tenancy campaigns on behalf of them anyway right now.",Access, Manual effort, Retailers, Reduce effort, Namespace (retailer setup), API, Retailer needs, Campaigns,,,,,,,,,,
"So that's the first one we run into is like, we have to get have to get the individual token. You have to make sure you're part of teams. So whatever token you're using or the token that we might get them to enter, they do have to make sure they're in multiple teams. And retailers are big. They have so many teams, so you have to be a part of a lot of teams to do this. And then you also see a slowdown in the UI when you're part of a lot of teams. So it's still kind of a work in progress. We're going to build it out and try it out and to how to kind of pass in those tokens for when we need to use that thing.",Manual effort, Frustration, Access, Retailer needs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We get into how we do it. I won't bore you with the details, but again, essentially, you're iterating through the rows in the CSV [export from BigQuery]. Checking if the campaign ID exists, and then deciding whether or not to do a patch or post. You have to convert the UTC time out of BigQuery into that Zulu time because the API won't accept it unless it's in that specific format. So you have to convert it. It's the same time anyway, but this just requires that specific format, I believe. I'm tried a couple of different ways [but] UTC doesn't seem to like it very much.",UPC or Identifier, Manual effort, Excel, BigQuery, Business challenge, Campaigns,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The other thing we do here is if there's no end date we can just kind of tell it, but it's always on. And what we had to do here, Dieter, was what we did originally was prior actually hitting the API is probably not a good way to check whether the product exists when the catalog. So what we do is - and this is still a work in progress - we actually call that V1 catalog products [old AdManager API] and we checked the response code. So if the response codes 200 [product exists in the catalog], we append the product that we're building, which is just the product object in the JSON response to the API call. If we get a 400, it means it's not found and we just don't add it. So we're essentially like building an API call by rolling through the rows and then rolling through the data within these rows. So like if there's two products here and there is one catalog, we just check them both against the catalog, right? So we just check if it exists. If it does, yes, it's OK to add. If it doesn't, don't add it. I see it gets a little bit intense when you check all these.",Products, API, Limitation, Frustration, Date or Time related, Catalog (retailer),,,,,,,,,,,,
"Kind of been playing around with actually using the API response. When it throws that error message earlier, which is why I raised it with you. Is like use the API response to then adjust your product list if the products not available because the API does respond in some use cases that this product is not a part of that catalog. Trying to decide which is better to do this way is definitely a lot slower because you're kind of like looping through and if you have like 5 catalogs, it's takes a little chugs a little bit, takes a lot of time to do all those API calls. I don't know if it's better or worse than making like 2 separate requests the API went through. But probably the latter is probably the better way to do it. Probably adjust for that. But essentially all you're doing is taking this product code, checking if it exists by using that V1 endpoint, and if it does, it's OK to add it",Gap (Product or Service), Errors or Issues, Products, API,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So I would just enter them, but what I don't know immediately is whether or not that product code's available in that particular catalog. That can be where it gets a little tricky. So you have to do that thing in the UI where you're like, I'll find out my product codes go and add them all, then I'll remove the catalogs where they don't appear.

We have kind of talked about a few different things like where can we look up the wallet ID if the wallet name is present and just populate it instead. It's because maybe they don't know the wallet ID, and is it easier if they know the name. Like they can just put the [wallet] name in and then we'll pull the ID in by hitting the wallet endpoint.

"Right now we're just kind of recording the responses that we see because what kind of error troubleshooting and like debugging the different use cases where you can run into different problems.

You run into some problems where like if the if you include a product catalog and if you include a catalog ID in the catalog list that doesn't exist on the products, you get an error. I think some of these things for me - and this might just be the approach that we're taking and happy to hear others suggestions - it is like nothing is assumed. So if you put something wrong in the API, immediately is like 'No way, I'm not doing that'. It doesn't like think like. OK, I'll just remove that. I can see what you're trying to do, I'll just remove that and I can throw you like an error. I'll remove this catalog ID. But it doesn't. It just stops you dead in your tracks. Which is kind of where we came to the viewpoint on the last call Ollie where it feels like the API right now expects you to have limited options in what you can enter. Like it's restricting you because it's really based on like... you couldn't enter something wrong in the UI. Like you can't make it wrong because you have limited options to select from.

I'm not sure if I'm creating a new campaign. Maybe, maybe not. Approval state. I think that's defined by the platform. The namespace admin. Again defined by where you are like you. You have to have the user key. The user key is associated with the namespace. So like where else could I be, you know? Like that's inferred, but I think you have to have that in there.

We can get the response like whether it's a 200 response and we just say like updated. Like, create a new column here [in the sample spreadsheet been displayed] and say like updated that. Then they could just come in and make adjustments.",Customer needs, Bulk actions, Excel, Consideration,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So you could even have like running reoccurring where it would just come in and like hit the API. Again, we kind of have this conversation with engineering around like how much can we hit this API? Is this actually like an open API? Is this something that we can use? Can we build things like this? It seems a little like last time I spoke with like Joe [Josip Vulic, previous VP of tech in AdManager], you know, when he was here and Dennis, they felt like, yeah, as long as you were using exposed endpoints, it's OK don't use internal ones.",API, Customer needs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So, I'm just commenting out this code here for this internal endpoint. We'll just pretend you didn't see that. But that's the kind of thing that we also need to understand is like, are we going to beat this environment into the ground by doing something like this, like, how things should we run something like this? What are the barriers here? What are some of the things we need to be wary of if we're doing something like this? Because it really does just simulate a bunch of people being in the platform, making campaign adjustments at the same time. But how often they're going to be doing that, the frequency of it? OK. Probably this is going to be a little bit more.",API, Concern or Worry, Business challenge, Understanding vague,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Maybe every hour or two?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I think what probably is a good thing to consider here is like the reason why they have to do so many updates. Rather than like how many did they do. And I think the primary reason is probably due to the lack of functionality in the platform around pacing and like things like that. So like the reason that they have to come in here so often and make so many updates is because the functionality is not there for it to happen for them. So like if you need to adjust the campaign or the campaigns spending too much or too many products in the campaign, nothing does that for you. It's all very manual, so you have to come in and update it like throughout the day to check the pacing or to add funds, or to shift a campaign to a new wallet, or things like that. And I'm not the best person to speak to it. But the platforms' very manual. So that's the requirement to constantly be very manual with the platform if you're trying to get budgets for your campaigns and you're trying to adjust things and make sure things spend the right time and like add and remove search terms or add or remove products, or make sure CPC's are lined up correctly, so you're winning at the right time in the day and you're getting the revenue. These are all kind of things that come into play.",Wallets, Limitation, Optimisation, Pacing, CPC (Cost Per Click), Search terms / Keywords, Revenue, Consideration, Products, Campaigns, Manual effort, Budget, Customer needs, Spend,,,,
"Exactly. Yes, like a lot of the strategy stuff for delivering a campaign is done manually. So like it's all manual. Which means that when we talk about  having to go in the UI and having to make adjustments and having to like change certain things, it seems like quite easy. But if you do it 100 times a day or 150 times a day, well now you're spending the majority of your time clicking around the UI just to make the strategy for a campaign correct. And as you extrapolate that out for multiple clients. Sure, some clients require more, some clients require less, but you start to see that time spent just like 'hands on' keyboard growing because there's not a lot of automation. There's not a lot of features and functionality that allow you to go in and do that. So I think this addresses that. So it addresses the hands-on keyboard time, but it probably doesn't address a larger problem, which is something that I think products looking at. Which is features and functionality that mean that while you can do this, you probably don't need to do it as often. Makes sense?",Campaigns, Optimisation, Manual effort,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yeah. And again, I'm not the best person to speak to it. But, if you're going to ask questions of the operations team, what I would be asking is like the 'Whys'. Why do you have to touch one campaign 10 times a day? Why you have to touch one campaign 15 times a day? Like how many campaigns, on average would you say you're touch? What are the things that you're touching like, are you just adjusting the Max bid? It's on the list, right? Like Max bid adjustment is on the list.",Optimisation, Managed service, Campaigns, Bidding,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Do you need to spend 15 to 20 seconds in the UI finding a campaign to change that value to that, for 100 campaigns? Probably not, right? But you do now. So those are the kind of things that I would be like, if I was you, narrowing in on what are the use cases and why do those use cases exist? Because I know it's not your squad, but like it will help inform product in general. Like how much time are we spending in the platform to adjust something that's isn't. And you know, why is it like that, and what's the best way to do it? Probably not, but that's where I'd start.",Manual effort, Campaigns, Optimisation, Future opportunity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What we're doing here is we're circumventing right, like we're just doing this stuff because we're kind of circumventing and kind of designing things to really get around what we feel like a limitation in the platform, right.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yeah. And that list ties back into what we're doing here. So you'll see like, oh OK that's how you're solving it by doing it like this. Again, I'm not pretending this is ideal by any stretch, but it solves the immediate problem and I think like API’s and really open API’s, they take a long time to build. And fully functional ones take a longer time to build. But as we grow and as we scale, we need a solution for them now. So we kind of look, look down here [to a list of Bulk Operation needs for customers] to try to do that. Yeah.",Bulk actions, Scaling, API, Analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yeah. Exactly. So you'll see if we go over the list like start and end date change. So you can come in here and you can change the start and end date. That's fine, Max bid change. You can come in here and change the Max bid. Campaign duplication, all you need to do is copy the row and delete the campaign ID and it will duplicate your campaign. Product removal, you can do that. Just remove the products from the cell and it will patch the existing campaign. Catalog removal, same deal. You can remove the catalog from that cell and it will do that catalog. New campaign build can come in here. And if you know your placements [ID's] and your teams like you can copy your row essentially and just delete certain things and it's already prefilled for you. The hard thing is like placement ID's and stuff like that. You know, it's kind of annoying, but you know, this might be where we encounter a few problems. You might need to know the placement ID because you need it to make the API call. And download full campaign setup details, I mean, this is exactly what we did at the start, right?",UPC or Identifier, Bidding, Campaigns, Bulk actions, API, Placements, Excel, Customer needs, Date or Time related, Future opportunity,,,,,,,,
"So yeah. And we'll encounter more things. Don't get me wrong. We will encounter new things as we start to like, use this. Of course we're figuring out the pieces here first.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So the other one is the access. But I think you already spoke about it a little bit. Like I have to kind of retrieve all these different user tokens for different environments to do like something on that environment. And also the team structure. So I have to be a part of that team as well, where the user has to be a part of multiple teams. I think if you're on the retailer team, you should probably be able to do things on behalf of teams because you could do that anyway in the in the UI if you're in there. You could just add yourself to the team and go wild.",Access, Limitation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yeah, like a master key kind of thing. And whether you want to do it like master user across multiple namespaces, that's probably pretty cool. But I guess if you're building or like a partner, how do you get like a master key to say like OK, I'm authorised to do things on namespace XYZ. And that means I've been given access to do those things. And you can record who did it and things like that. But I don't need to be on every team and every time create a team for that. And I can do things on behalf of teams. I can go in and make adjustments, you know, I don't need to kind of constantly go to each environment, get a user key, use that user key and then you know reset it. And you can still have your bearer token for that user key. That's fine. But it's more about, I need an individual key to access each individual environment. Not only that, my user needs to be a part of every single team that I want to touch in that environment. So now my users are part of 150 teams across the name spaces. Seems a little lethargic for trying to do like bulk operations. Whereas when we're operating from - operationally -we're touching multiple environments all the time, right? And you're always going between environments, but you're having to log into that environment and go through the same process we just talked about to just adjust one campaign. Like is there a way to do that across all environments? That's going to save a heap of time, right. Like I can just go in and have a master list of all the environments that I'm working from, and I can make adjustments.",Limitation, Frustration, Bulk actions, Access, Namespace (retailer setup),,,,,,,,,,,,,
Similar thing you see from the API here is like the authentication. Not being able to do it across multiple places without logging in per se.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And the other one I have is like doesn't seem to infer a lot. You have to be very specific again. Like you know, can I remove namespace ID? Probably not. I think it will fail. I can try. But if I'm logged into environment and I have a user key from that environment that's specific to it, why don't I need to give the API on namespace ID? Where else could I be? It knows that I'm from that namespace from my user key, so don't need that? Stuff like that.",API, Reduce effort, Namespace (retailer setup),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Can I use a placement name instead of a placement ID? And I guess you could have two placements that are the same name. It's pretty rare, but maybe it would be better instead of having a placement ID that you can use the name and we just make a restriction on unique names within a singular namespace, you know.",Placements, API, UPC or Identifier, Namespace (retailer setup),,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yeah, makes sense. I think the only other thing is like sometimes I wonder about if we look at this [sharing the API swagger]. Let's have a look here. And I know this API box has worked for some reason, I'm sure I'll figure it out tonight, Dieter. But is there any reason why I can't list the catalog ID and then and array of products [under the listed catalog]?",Guides and support material, API, Business challenge,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"OK, but could be like, so I put like my products here and my catalog ID's. In a perfect world, just because we run into this problem very recently. Like I put all my catalog ID's in, and I put in my product codes and then they just go to the catalogs that they're available in.",UPC or Identifier, Catalog (retailer), Products,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yes. I mean, I would say it's just very specific. It's very specific about what it needs. Whereas if I gave you a list of catalog ID's, right. You know the catalogs I want to have advise on. And then I just gave you a list of product codes. And I guess, probably the use case the other way around where it's like what if I don't want a product to appear in that. What if I don't want to mark [a product] against that particular catalog. Maybe you could be like an exclusion or something, but I think it's a more long way of doing things. I don't know if that's the right word.",Customer needs, Products, Catalog (retailer),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yeah. Another thing that would be great is if I wanted to do both operations, can I just give you like my campaign ID and what I want to change?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Oh really?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
OK. Yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Oh that'd be great. That's very helpful. That's excellent. It's good to know.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pardon.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

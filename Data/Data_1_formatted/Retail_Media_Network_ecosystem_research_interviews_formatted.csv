What you mean behaviour?,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"That makes sense. So I think the trend in the you know, the more recent past has been retailers really wanting to own it. The more self-aware retailers that have been led by consultants or just arrived to it [RMN’s], realised like they can't do it alone.",Advice and guidance, Retailers, Moderate Alignment,,,,,,,,,,
"I think all of them kind of realised it now, they need some kind of tech to power it, but it doesn't just stop at tech. Obviously sales is a the component which a lot of retailers you know think that they can sell it themselves. But it's more than just squeezing your suppliers [for money].",Business norm, Business challenge, Managing expectations, Ad Tech, Retailers, Moderate Alignment,,,,,,,
"What I found from the market brand and agencies is the retail media flywheel is real. And when I say the flywheel, it's easier to work with better performance drives, more dollars into the system. Easier to work with ROAS [as it] drives more dollars into the system.",Performance, Reporting, ROAS, Agencies, Brands, Moderate Alignment,,,,,,,
"And especially out of the gate, there's always growing pains whenever you switch solutions, technology, you know it's never completely seamless because it's not all in us [AdManager], right. The brands play a part in that. Agencies play a part in that. And there's differences between platforms, and I think for me a big trend that I'm seeing right now is a little bit of like a call to arms for standardisation. Especially in reporting like you see Albertsons really trumpeting it like they want standardisation, but there's not really this like IAB type platforms for retail media yet.",Business challenge, Ad Tech, Reporting, Albertsons, AdManager, IAB, Agencies, Brands, Support & guidance, High Alignment,,,
"The definition of ROAS is highly subjective. Even [with] our own retailers, the definition of ROAS is subjective. Some are on a 14 day [reporting cycle], some are on a 30 day, some are on a Halo, some are whatever. So like standardisation, and I think you know, retailers, they can't do that alone. I don't think even retailers individually can do it online. It's like where we need to come together.",Business challenge, Reporting, ROAS, Retailers, Halo reporting, Standardisation & transparency, High Alignment,,,,,,
But the more we can have a point of view on ROAS. And the more we can be transparent about what's included in our ROAS - and I think that's where design probably comes into play - is how do we be clear about what's included in our ROAS that it is transparent.,Opportunities, Reporting, ROAS, AdManager, Standardisation & transparency, Support & guidance, High Alignment,,,,,,
"A lot of other partners outside of AdManager are a lot more aggressive and how they determine ROAS. But they do it under a black box. They'll include everything in it versus us, that’s very specific [AdManager].",Business challenge, ROAS, AdManager, High Alignment,,,,,,,,,
"Like Instacart, they [partners or competitors] count out of stocks in their ROAS number. And if you guys know that here States-side. So they're like counting a sale even when it wasn't a sale. We don't do that, right. The item is picked in store and that's when it goes to sale and our side. So, anyways I feel like I'm kind of going off on a tangent. But those are like a couple of trends of you know retailers. They know they want to do it because they want the best margins that they can. That's just a retailer thing, right? They always negotiate for the best margin to get the best margins when they control it, soup to nuts [idiom for “from beginning to end"" or “start to finish”]. But they can't do it themselves, soup to nuts.",Competitors, Opportunities, ROAS, AdManager, InstaCart, Support & guidance, High Alignment,,,,,,
Another piece as we’re onboarding more and more retailers. Order-to-cash is real. I often refer to it as like the dark underbelly of retail media. Like getting and realising revenue from retail media from an order to cash-in-hand is hard.,Business challenge, Revenue, ROAS, Retailers,,,,,,,,,
"It's very, very hard because it's not just “OK, I spent a dollar and then I invoiced it”. It's also you have to abide by the IAB rules of “OK, after the month ends, I need to invoice but it can't exceed the overall contracted amount and it can't exceed the end date”. So like time zones which we incur, sometimes a few dollars will run after the month end because of the time zones that we can't invoice at that. So again, order-to-cash and understanding “OK, these suppliers spent this and then I recognise cash at the end of the day. And then it's remitted to me”. It's hard and we're still figuring it out internally.",Business challenge, Revenue, Spend, IAB, Retailers, Low Alignment,,,,,,,
"What I found here Stateside is most retailers who have elected AdManager have usually already engaged some kind of consultant. Whether it is Sapient, whether it is Deloitte or there's, you know, 3, 4, or 5 others. And all of them are smelling blood in the water because you see all these like ‘thought leadership’ pieces being sent out into the market, even they're engaging us because they, they don't even know about retail media as well as us. But that thought leadership then translate into what you know they call blueprints.",Advice and guidance, AdManager, Deloitte, Sapient, Agencies, Partners, Retailers, USA, Support & guidance, Low Alignment,,,
"And so when retailers weren't aware of these things, that's what the consultants do. [They] pull them across. I'd say they're probably best at some of the data privacy things. That's where they're most experienced. Just because it can be written down and read and regurgitated. Where they're [consultants] not very good is on the operational piece of it. Because they write a blueprint, they deliver the blueprint, they go away. And then it's up to AdManager and our services teams to pick up the pieces. Because no matter the best blueprint you have, we don't run static businesses.",Business norm, Business challenge, Advice and guidance, Opportunities, AdManager, Agencies, Retailers, High Alignment,,,,,
"It may be a great, what is it that Mike Tyson quote “Everybody's got a plan until they get punched in the face”. Like retail media, you get punched in the face every single day because we don't operate in a vacuum.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And you know, there's new players entering. There's brands that, you know, changing objectives. You got agencies that have their own objectives. And it's just “Make my life easy and make me look great to the brand”. So to your point, they usually know, but it's driven by a third party in the consultants.",Agencies, Retailers, Concern or Worry, Advice and guidance, Brands, High Alignment,,,,,,,
"It's evolving for sure, and rapidly. And I think we've also been on a roller coaster admittedly. Like COVID put us on a roller coaster where we were like going up and up. And then you're kind of at this lull. I think it'll continue to go up, but just not at a rate that it was before.",Complexity,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So I come from a company where Jimmy and I worked at previously that first and foremost, they helped retailers power ecommerce. And so I think it's important to know like that's step one for all of these retailers is how do they get their ecommerce sites, the fulfillment, the picking in-store, right?",Business norm, eCommerce, Reactive vs Proactive, Retailers, High Alignment,,,,,,,,
"And then you know, the Ad-tech really becomes a layer on top of that. Some retailers are easier than others. Some are doing it better than others. I think, admittedly, Amazon's been doing it a long time, but they're mostly like a pure-play online retailer and it makes it a little bit easier. They were built as that. But then you have an Ahold Delhaize who was not born and bred, you know, other than Peapod as a pure-play online retailer.",Business challenge, Complexity, Knowledge gap, Ad Tech, Ahold Delhiaze, Peapod, Amazon, High Alignment,,,,,
"And so, you know, they're [Ahold Delhaize] also five different retailers in one. They're a company of acquisitions and a lot of retailers are like that too. They've acquired different businesses and tag them on. They might be across other ecommerce platforms and so you Ahold as an example right now they have 3 retailers on one ecommerce platform and then two on others and ones in a migration.",Complexity, Acquisitions, Ahold Delhiaze, Retailers, High Alignment,,,,,,,,
"So just the infrastructure itself that we’re attaching on to is in flux. Which means the Ad-tech is in flux, which actually makes it harder for brands and agencies than to operate. [For example] for Food Lion on Ahold, they're on the Quotient platform still. But we're helping them activate those dollars when all the other retailers, the banners, the Ahold banners are on the AdManager platform.",Operational structure, Ad Tech, Ahold Delhiaze, Food Lion, AdManager, Quotient, Partners,,,,,,
"I think we're all just figuring it out. And I think the other trend that I'm seeing for more mature retailers, even if their ecommerce is solid, say like a Target or a Walmart or you know an Amazon. Now they're in a period of how do they diversify their Ad-tech and get like the most dollars possible. And a lot of them are doing it by diversifying their Ad-tech partners. And so you have supply side partners like AdManager or Criteo that have kind of been the historical guys. But then you have a lot of these, like aggregators or integrators we call them like a Skai and Pacvue.",Ad Tech, Competitors, Diversity, eCommerce, Target, Walmart, Amazon, AdManager, Criteo, Pacvue, Skai (Kenshoo), High Alignment,
"You also have agencies that have their own Ad-tech but are fingers on keyboards like Flywheel or Tinuiti, Stable or Harvest Group here in the US. They bring in supply, but then they make it easier for these brands to activate not only on that retailer, but across all retailers, right?",Competitor advantage, Ad Tech, Competitors, Opportunities, Flywheel Digital, Harvest Group, The Stable, Tinuiti, Agencies, Brands, USA,,
"So it's very much, I came up in like the publisher world like [the] lifestyle publisher world. And we saw this exact kind of trend where all these publishers, content platforms [etc.] built up their own platforms. But then at some point the brand said “I can't activate across all of these. It's too hard. We need a programmatic way of doing this”. And that's where programmatic media happened. And you can buy across all of them because it's standardised Ad placements.",Ad Tech, Reactive vs Proactive, Brands, Standardisation & transparency, High Alignment,,,,,,,,
"And to me, these integrator or aggregators help provide that and that's why I think our API is so important. Because we can buck the trend [of integration or partnering] and we can try to be the sole provider. Or we can go along with it and allow these retailers and these brands to connect the way that they want to connect.",API, Integration, Opportunities, Brands, Retailers,,,,,,,,
"And that to me again is the retail media flywheel of making it easier, getting better reporting which drives more dollars into the system. So at one end you have infrastructure. At another end you have revenue diversification.",Diversity, Opportunities, Reporting, Revenue, High Alignment,,,,,,,,
And most retailers like the big ones are higher on the diversification. The new ones are definitely just on the infrastructure and trying to get it right but also driving the adoption because it's crowded. It's crowded from the RMN space and a lot of the brands are still in early days and they're trying to figure out where do the funds come from. Because historically there are a number of funds that retail media can play in.,Business challenge, Budget, Diversity, Spend, Brands, Retailers, Moderate Alignment,,,,,,
"So there is ecommerce, which is historically “How do I drive more online sales?”. There is shopper marketing dollars, which is much more around “How do I advertise online but ultimately drive in-store sales?”. And then there are brand dollars which are coming down traditional marketing dollars. And the fourth is really trade [spend]. And trade is something held close to the vest by the merchant team, invite only. You got to be careful and tread lightly.",Trade marketing/spend, Knowledge gap, eCommerce, Sales, Spend, Brand needs, Moderate Alignment,,,,,,
"And so where we've historically played as like shopper [spend] and ecommerce [spend], which typically flowed down from brand and then trade is separate. Normally, brand [spend] doesn't flow into trade, but brand flows into the ecommerce and shopper marketing.",Trade marketing/spend, eCommerce, Spend, Brands, Moderate Alignment,,,,,,,,
"But these brands don't have it all figured out in terms of that fund flow and they're still opportunity to influence those brand dollars. So you know Meta, Facebook… not as popular as it once was. A lot of those dollars are now siphoning more into retail media. Or you see a lot of retail media networks like Kroger and Instacart trumpeting CTV [Connected TV] and OLV [Online Video]. Why are they doing that?",Knowledge gap, Budget, Digital channels, Kroger, Digital video, Facebook, InstaCart, Meta, Brands, Moderate Alignment,,,
They're doing that because they can capitalise on the legacy TV dollars. So those are new buckets of money that they can trickle down and grab from. But brands don't have it figured out.,Knowledge gap, Opportunities, Brands, Retailers, Moderate Alignment,,,,,,,,
"And so you have the retailers shouting “I want more money”. And then the brands are like “OK, how do I go find this money?”. And if you talk to an agency, they're going to say “I only have this amount of money” because that's all they have been allocated.",Business norm, Managing expectations, Spend, Agencies, Brands, Retailers, High Alignment,,,,,,
"But then, we [AdManager] got to go and talk to those brand managers, or we got to find an advocate who will go and get those dollars from the brand teams.",Business strategy, Advice and guidance, Spend, AdManager, Moderate Alignment,,,,,,,,
"The trade piece I will follow up with you. It's never entirely net new dollars. Retailers don’t want to hear that. But McKinsey’s run a study on where these dollars coming from, and I'll share that with you because I think it's a good response.",Retailers, Moderate Alignment,,,,,,,,,,,
"I agree SPA [Sponsored Product Ads] is a ‘gateway drug’ and that's why I think we required by EllisX. Because it's the next [big thing]. There's always a finite amount of inventory onsite, it just is. There's pretty much unlimited inventory offsite. And we found that 80% of consumers don't engage with the owned and operated properties known as the in-store. And that's where the offsite comes into play.",Business challenge, In-store, Sponsored Product Ads (SPA), AdManager, EllisX, Retailers, High Alignment,,,,,,
"So I think I'm going to do the hostage [theme] because it's fun. Me from a sales end of it, coming from lifestyle publishers where you had to sell and you were kind of in it alone, the retailers are the Big Brother. And we play into that here Stateside as a service organisation. We lock arms with the retailer if we get in with the merchants. Like retailers are King and Queens of the retailer world and they do have sway with these brands.",Concern or Worry, Brands, USA, High Alignment,,,,,,,,,
"But to your point, we also hear back from the merchant, [stating] it does have to perform. And we have to prove out the effectiveness [of RMN’s] and for a long time ROAS return on Ad spend has been accepted but I think that's now getting challenged.",ROAS, Spend, Brands, High Alignment,,,,,,,,,
"Some people are abusing it. Some partners are [too]. I think AdManager takes a very conservative stance on it. But as more and more dollars get funnelled into retail media, it's the lowest funnel tactic. It's sometimes very easy to get a good ROAS too. And I think that's why brands are asking “OK, ROAS is great. But with my incremental sales…”. And so that's a big trend that we're seeing right now is more and more brands are wanting to know not only what was ‘my sales’ but what was incremental that I wouldn't have gotten otherwise.",Business challenge, Incremental sales, ROAS, ROI, AdManager, Brands, Partners, High Alignment,,,,,
Example: Retailer expects to sell $50k of a product. The campaign costs $20k and ends up selling $80k in sales.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Incremental sales is $80 - $50k = $30k],,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Sometimes we can't always prove that. So what we try to do is at least say “OK, well your sales are growing or maybe they're declining, you need to, you know, spend more type of thing”. But it is a common question and this sales media is retail media and we merge the two.",Business challenge, Sales, Spend, Brand needs, High Alignment,,,,,,,,
"So we're always trying to match a data-led story with what we're selling, into the brand. Or creating like fear of missing out, you know from the sales end of it. If you can say your competitor is growing share because they're investing more and they’re present more than you are at the digital shelf like that's a great motivator. It sells itself?",Concern or Worry, Advice and guidance, Data, Metrics, Sales, Brands, Partners, Low Alignment,,,,,
"We have to go, man-to-man combat. Criteo uses branded terms a lot to inflate their ROAS. And that's the point we try to dispel because if you're running sponsored products on your branded terms, chances are somebody's going to click on it; somebody's going to buy it and your ROAS is outstanding.",Business challenge, Competitors, ROAS, Criteo, High Alignment,,,,,,,,
"What's harder is non-branded terms. And so we try to point to those things as differentiators when brand say “Oh, I get a much better ROAS on Criteo and Target” and [AdManager is] like, wait a minute here let's peel this back. So we actually play into that kind of question mark scenario that brands you're hearing from in the market and these trade articles.",Business challenge, Data, ROAS, Target, AdManager, Criteo, Brands, High Alignment,,,,,
"OK, there's so much in the other stuff as well. I just wanted to send you an email [to cover the additional topics]. We'll do it email first and then if we need to hop on it, it would be great because there's a lot to unpack there. And a lot of what I asked you in more depth.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The one last thing I want to ask you, Jaclyn, is around some of the comments you've made is as we open up more of this agency on the on the side. Like self-agency for brands on their side. Where they can do an awful lot more and serve an awful lot more and report and place ads across networks and off lot more. What do you think is going to be the outcome or the and would there be a reaction on the retail side?",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Because essentially what we're doing, we're opening up the brands to kind of manage how they want a kind of remove a little bit of that power away from the walled gardens of brands and their own internal retail networks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"How do you think that's going to play out? Do you see any potential strains there where we have customers on both sides, retail and brand and now we're giving more power to potentially [the] brands?",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I think it has to happen. I think it's already happening here Stateside, probably even more so than abroad. And also because like agencies are involved.",Moderate Alignment,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I'm also very much across our API which plays into the aggregators. I guess, some retailers might push back. But it's also just the retail media flywheel again. A lot of these consultants are going to tell the retailers “You need to start to operate like a media company”.",Business challenge, API, Retailers,,,,,,,,,,
"And some media companies say the Facebooks and the Instagrams of the world can operate as a walled garden because of their scale. And Amazon might be able to operate as a walled garden and Walmart might be able to. But like at some point you just get to a saturated saturation point and it's just too many walled gardens. And if you're too hard to work with and you're not going to get the dollars either, no matter how good you perform. And so I think it's going to evolve because it has here Stateside. There might be some resistance.",Disruption, Walmart, Value or belief, Facebook, Instagram, USA, Moderate Alignment,,,,,,
"So we don't maybe have to disclose as confidential of information. But I also think it's a monetisation opportunity and the smartest retailers will start to realise that. Whether it's like “OK, invest this much and we will disclose this data, or we'll charge this much for our data because there is value against it”.",Data, Opportunities, Revenue, Retailers, High Alignment,,,,,,,,
"So if anything, I would advise the retailer to play into that. Figure out what your value is. And even to us as a company, you know, figure out what the ‘get’ is and make sure we are charging the retailer who's then charging the brand. Like, don't give it away for free.",Data, Opportunities, Reporting, Partners, Retailers, High Alignment,,,,,,,
"So I'll ask the first one which was trade funds. What have you seen around that that movement of money? Is it new budgets are being created or is it being used from other areas like ecomm [ecommerce budgets]. Because the concept in one of the reports that we read was around that notion that they're not getting any more money [brands are not providing new budgets] but rather just sloshing it around from other areas rather than growing that retail media section of funds itself. So have you noticed any trends, or I guess any insights that you can speak to around this?",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Just following up from our last catch-up out with some questions. Just kind of around trade funds and around the reports. [And] brands and retail is kind of going more up the consumer funnel. Exploring more than sponsored Ads and just kind of chatting about how brands are kind of, I guess pushing back in a sense. Or finding that they they're not getting the value out of some retailers that they were initially promised [better outcomes]. So trying to explore that a bit more.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"McKinsey did a study on it, and it does pull from other buckets, you know, some of it is a bit Net new. There's some [budget] that gets pulled from trade, but it does depend on how much the retailer is leaning in.",Retailers, Budget, Incremental sales, Brands, Trade marketing/spend, Moderate Alignment,,,,,,,
"My team when I have a sales team out in market, you know the lowest hanging fruit for us that we have easy access to without the retailer’s involvement and the merchants team involvement. The dollars are tagged as ecomm [budget]. They're tagged as shopper marketing.",Budget, eCommerce, Moderate Alignment,,,,,,,,,,
"I'd say that's probably some of the biggest pool [is] that legacy shopper marketing dollars are increasingly coming into retail media [budgets]. Especially through digital channels. And the difference between ecomm and shopper is ecomm typically the KPI is around online sales and shopper is around in-store sales. So that's also where you see a lot of these retail media networks you know was led by Walmart starting to include online sales because those shopper dollars need to be tracked to omni-channel sales. So Walmart did it. Now Targets’ doing it and now like a lot of other retailers, are following.",Budget, eCommerce, In-store, Target, Walmart, Aggregated reporting, Moderate Alignment,,,,,,
"But ultimately, you know what is happening a little bit and needs to happen more is more dollars flow into these channels through brand. So maybe legacy traditional TV, more of that's going into CTV [Connected TV]. Or maybe, you know, social [media] dollars. Maybe they're not investing as much into meta or Facebook anymore. And those [budgets] are flowing more [to retail media]. Maybe they're running social dollars through retail media data? That kind of thing.",Spend, CTV (Connected TV), Social media, Brands, Moderate Alignment,,,,,,,,
"So I say a little bit in trade, not as much, but more or less in these other ecomm [and] shopper marketing budgets and these brands are in a little bit of a renaissance of “OK retailer asking more where does it come from? OK, it has to come from some of these other legacy channels”.",Trade marketing/spend, Budget, eCommerce, Revenue, Retailers, Moderate Alignment,,,,,,,
So they're still kind of pulling from those other channels to grow.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"You're always pulling from different ones. It's just, you know, which ones are growing. What is low hanging fruit. And then in terms of the retail media ask because all these retailers, they keep asking for more and more and more each year, right? They got to come from somewhere. It's not like the brand overall marketing budgets are increasing by that much.",Business challenge, Budget, Revenue, Spend, Retailers, Retailer needs, Moderate Alignment,,,,,,
I'll just open it up to Colin and Jimmy if they have any kind of questions on that matter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Oh, interesting. So it's a little bit they're reverse. Say it again to me, just some wrap my brain around it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Interesting. It makes sense. I think it's behaviour that's probably been driven a lot by Amazon. So you see it a lot of like cross-retailers or like “Let me let me check Amazon, they usually have the lowest price”. But it's interesting if consumers are latching on to that and saying, OK, maybe it's not even Amazon, maybe it's just this retailer site that has lower prices. I haven't heard of a ton of that lately, at least here Stateside. For us, often, especially in the grocery channel, which is really our bread and butter. Something like an Instacart. Obviously, we don't have Instacart. But Instacart we found their prices are usually more [higher] than what's in-store because they have a little bit of a service charge fee. So I say less prevalent seeing that, but it makes sense. Just don't have clear trends to it.",Fees or Charges, Spend, Amazon, InstaCart, USA, High Alignment,,,,,,,
"So we've also noticed a bit of a trend in some of the reports. And it's similar to a retailer over here called Coles, that retailers have kind of bled sponsored Ads to death, so to speak. [In the report] referring to it as a ‘gateway drug’ to retail media.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And kind of supported by what you said last time they’re [brands] are now hooked and looking for more, especially from up the consumer funnel, into that awareness, consideration kind of area and exploring things like video and out of home [OO] video and trying to really create and explore more of that whole digitally connected RMN universe. Can you speak a bit to that and what you've noticed I've seen regarding that?",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I think that's spot on. You know on-site search is usually the first area that brands want to invest. I would say some of the big brands are questioning [on-site] search, which is also interesting. While it's a ‘’gateway drug, some of them been around for a while and they're also questioning “OK. Am I going to get this sale anyway?”",Concern or Worry, On-site, Search terms / Keywords, Brands, Moderate Alignment,,,,,,,,
"So there's an incrementality piece. I know we talked a lot about reporting the last go around of like what's the incremental lift. And incrementality though like that to me comes higher in the funnel, right? And that's why it makes sense. OK, start with search. Maximise there, but don't forget about the other higher funnel tactics because a lot of times retailers don't let brands conquest, right.",Knowledge gap, Incremental sales, Opportunities, Brands, Moderate Alignment,,,,,,,,
"So you're just, you're reaching whoever you're probably going to reach before [in on-site]. But how do you drive new into the pool? How do you get on the list or get in with the consideration set. And you got to do that before they're [consumers] searching for cheese or Kraft cheese. You've got to do that earlier.",Business growth, Business challenge, Awareness (funnel), Consideration (funnel), On-site, Brand needs, High Alignment,,,,,,
"I think it's also a natural extension because retailers are asking for more dollars, right? On-site has finite inventory. Brands will not be able to meet those commits if they only focus on search or on-site display. They [retailers] have to go outside of that. So I think that's also kind of opening things up in terms of the interest. I think it's brand but it’s also the retailers influence driving it.",Limitation, On-site, Reactive vs Proactive, Retailers, Moderate Alignment,,,,,,,,
"Would we just say that they're starting to, I guess, see that taking the lens off of just sponsored Ads to see that “Ok, it is actually all connected here, you know. We really need to be looking outside of one [RMN] site to boost on-site essentially”.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"That's right. And that's that is the really fun problem that we're looking to solve with the unified platform that really nobody else does with that reporting, right. If you can show that unified reporting against the on-site and the off-site, that's awesome. Because right now, partners [agencies] just show either or. But what we found is when you run both it makes the overall pool lift of ROAS and sales.",Off-site, On-site, Opportunities, Reporting, ROAS, Agencies, Aggregated reporting, Moderate Alignment,,,,,

"Yeah.  So we'll pull the organic sales pre, during, and post and measure the lift. Or we'll just look “OK, so you have ‘always on’ search and we post in an offsite campaign [data].

"And just lastly, we briefly chatted about this last catch up and Jimmy touched on. It was this notion of a of one-sided relationship or as Colin likes to refer to it as like a hostage relationship between brands and some retailers. The idea that if they don't go with some of these retailers, they're going to miss out and or be in bad faith, lose their rank.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"On the flip side of that coin and in one of the Forbes articles we read, the brands are now beginning to kind of think for themselves, and question, the value of that spend because they aren't actually getting that value back. And you touched on this briefly again, last catch up, the idea of interconnectivity of like a ‘glue piece’. The piece that kind of glues everything together, connected to all the reports et cetera. And do you want to elaborate deeper on that and discuss any insights or finding you're seeing in that space?",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yeah, it's always the sales conundrum because when we get into a challenge, we do always call the retailer for help. And you know, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. But you know the best relationships and when the spend continues, it's when not only do we have the retailer alignment, but the retail media flywheel is at play.",Business norm, Business challenge, Spend, Partners, Retailers, Moderate Alignment,,,,,,,
"So we are operating the way that they want to operate. It is easy. It is performing and so then it becomes an easier growth pattern versus always having to strong-arm the retailer and at some point too, the merchants get fatigued. And the merchants are numbers driven, always. And so they too want to see the performance and to stand by [it] you know. They need the backing [performance metrics] in order to stand by the program.",Business norm, Performance, Metrics, Reporting, High Alignment,,,,,,,,
"So if sales are dipping, they'll say “OK, maybe we will work with this other tactic. Maybe we'll put more push more into the circular”. That kind of thing, even though it's not tracked. So they do have to work concurrently.",Sales, Reactive vs Proactive, Moderate Alignment,,,,,,,,,,
"And the other success that we have when starting a program - best in classes you start with your largest brands because those get the clicks. And then you work down the line [to lesser brands/products] because if a big brand isn't running “OK, well, let's find their next competitor and the next competitor and the next competitor”. And when those start running, we end up pulling sales data that says “Listen your shares dropping. If you don't run, you're losing share”. And that tends to be a motivating factor. Just that fear of missing out.",Business norm, Business strategy, Concern or Worry, Advice and guidance, Reporting, Partners, Low Alignment,,,,,,
"To say how a brand was going back into their own internal stakeholders and pushing from our budget. Yeah, I think performance helps.

But guess what your competitor over here is 40% and their sales are growing, you know incrementally by you know 25% month over month”.

"No. To be honest, this is my first stint as such in retail media. But been familiar with it before as well while I was a brand owner. So I was kind of, you know, spending money on ecommerce platforms in India. So spending money on platforms like Amazon. We have something as big as Amazon called Flipkart, who's a big marketplace as well, which is now owned by Walmart. So, you know, in familiar and spending money on those platforms as well, yeah.",Walmart, Anecdotal, India, Amazon, Flipkart, eCommerce,,,,,,,

"We've had the Criteo in the market now for almost over about five years. So they've been an early mover in this country. And although the model which they operate with is a little different from what other markets they operate in. So they don't really sort of hard sell tech. They tried that for about closer to about 9 or 10 months initially, and they realised that they don't do that in this country [India].",Business challenge, Competitors, Criteo, India, Low Alignment,,,,,,,,
"But what they [Criteo] smartly did is they partnered along with the largest ecommerce company here called Flipkart, I spoke about earlier, which is Walmart owned.

"So they [Flipkart] are a very large and media sales company in this country. And I think almost any brand that you sort of speak with whose advertising on ecommerce, within their media plan, Flipkart is like a line item.",eCommerce, Flipkart, India,,,,,,,,,,
"It's like saying if you want to do Google; you want to do social [media channels]; you want to do pretty much other things, you know, ecommerce equals to either Amazon or Flipkart in the country.

We are only seeing, you know, then sort of growing upwards as well.",Business growth, eCommerce, Amazon, Flipkart, Google, Social media, India, Moderate Alignment,,,,,
"So wireless cost, I don't know how much you're familiar with digital landscape with an India, but with some of the one of the fastest growing digital media in terms of spends from advertisers. The spend is average of about 17% to 19% overall. And we grow almost by about 12% to 14% year on year as well.",Business growth, Mobile, Spend, India, Moderate Alignment,,,,,,,,
"If you were to look at that mix of digital advertising, ecommerce is now of that hundred [percent] is closer to about 12% of your overall pot is very commerce sort of contributes into as well.

"Within this space. I think the largest spenders typically are either companies in the CPG [Consumer Packaged Goods] space, which is FMCG [Fast Moving Consumer Goods], and CPG.

There's a second sort of leader in the game in India.",Business norm, Budget, Mobile, Spend, CPG (Consumer Packaged Goods), FMCG, India, Moderate Alignment,,,,,
So that's really the broader sort of canvas of how it’s sort of grown.  I think while Criteo was doing this evangelisation in the market we launched as well. I think we've been able to sort of put out the thought of retailers creating their own sort of asset of retail media.,Competitors, Criteo, India, Retailers, Low Alignment,,,,,,,,
"In the process I think some companies have floated [RMN’s] and done some stuff on their own. So we have two large giants in India which is sort of companies that they sort of hold own across verticals. There's one group called Tata and there's one group called Reliance.

"So I think the Ad sales team, who is internal to Big Basket is doing a good job. And because of that I think because [RMN] industry is very small, [the] word is permeated across other retailers as well. We see even smaller retailers, not necessarily within grocery but within say other areas of pharmacy, apparel, clothing, whatever taking on to it as well. So some of them, of course doing things with their own. Some of them are a bit sort of non-tech.

It'll tell you the leaders names and give you a sure short thought process of how important it is becoming in terms of not just a sort of from… it's more from all the functions right.

We just need more PR.",Opportunities, Spend, AdManager, WPP, Support & guidance, High Alignment,,,,,,,
That’s right.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So I think it's a combination of both. So while Flipkart's got its own sort of way of doing things. So the two big daddies are Flipkart and Amazon. The other sort of retailers are either doing some stuff on their own or their partnering with us.,Amazon, Flipkart, Partners, Retailers, Moderate Alignment,,,,,,,,

"So clearly in that space, we don't really have too much competition in this market with Microsoft [PromoteIQ]. So that's really how we’re placed in terms of sort of tech enablers. And of course in our process of where we keep meeting your retailers and prospecting them we do come across Criteo often enough. But I think it's just the way they are slightly priced.

"You know globally a lot of the nomenclature [naming language] seems to be around retail media, for some strange reason India seems to call it eCommerce media.

That's what I think typically it gets classified as.",eCommerce, India, Value or belief,,,,,,,,,,
"So having said that, I think what's happening is pretty much like all other retailers as well. There are the category teams who sort of aggressively trying to create awareness with the brands to sort of say “Hey, you can now spend across on our ecommerce platform, which is now advertiser friendly as well or brand friendly as well”. There have been some instances where they're setting up teams internally itself. So a classical case is that of, you know, our partner, which is Big Basket.",Staffing or Resourcing, Categories, Spend, Big Basket, Partners, Retailers, Moderate Alignment,,,,,,
So instantly they've got a 6-member team dedicated to just media sales. And the person who leads it is ex-Amazon. So interestingly there also sort of making sure that the people you know [in] the companies setting up the teams internally are making sure they choose the right people to sort of set those teams up as well.,Staffing or Resourcing, Amazon, Capability and expertise,,,,,,,,,,
"The same is the case with, say, a pharmacy we work with as well. So even there they have set up their own team. We have a 4-member team there who's sort of selling retail media, eCommerce media, whatever you want to call it? And we see similar trends pretty much across that. And given the size of the nation that we are, it's important that a retailer would at least have their own little army and not depend in terms of, you know someone else to sell that on behalf of them.",Staffing or Resourcing, eCommerce, India, Retailers, Capability and expertise, High Alignment,,,,,,,
"It's a mixture of things. So I think some are on that journey to find those teams. Some, obviously are putting up their own category guys to just talk about that as well. So it's a mix of both of them. There is no short answer in terms of what is the 100% way of doing it right or wrong. Pretty much like. I'm sure like any other market as well.

"So for example, I can tell you that the top 20 advertisers in the country and within their digital team, they would have a specialist for eCommerce.

Yes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is interesting how it's grouped in ecommerce media.

"Number one, video. Number two, something you can perhaps link with a social [media channels] perspective.

And they said, why don't you do some stuff in video? Because it's important for women to see how they can apply makeup. So that's a feature which they've [Nykaa] in fact done some stuff on their own.

Not massively. I think it's definitely slowed down in comparison to obviously what we were seeing through COVID. I think that the pressure and the drivers has definitely changed a little bit over the last couple of years in terms of how fast they [retailers] want to move.,Business challenge, Moderate Alignment,,,,,,,,,,,
But what I am seeing is the need state for things like personalisation is much higher than it has ever been. Wanting to bring more products into a call. Wanting to be able to make it very specific for a customer as they go through has never been more prominent than the conversations that we have with a lot of our particularly UK [retailers].

There may be where we were about five years ago.,Personalisation, EMEA, Europe, Retailers, UK, Moderate Alignment,,,,,,,

"It's the retailers. Particularly here in the UK. It's Tesco who are the biggest ones pushing it? Nectar360 is certainly on the route as well.

"The [data] insights is the piece. So rather than it being about the placements, the insights the [important] piece. And they're looking for the extra layers now.

"Old hat here in the UK used to be that 60% to 70% of your marketing budget would go into Tesco and the remaining amount would be split between everyone else due to the size of the company and the [in-store] footfall and everything. Whereas now that's not the same because they [retailers] don't have the same offering. So brands are having to think a lot more about their digital landscape and their digital investments because with the change in what they're doing and the fact that they can't just look at everything in one place, it becomes very hard for them to slice up the pot of money that they have.",Digital channels, In-store, Spend, Tesco, Gap (Product or Service), Brands, UK, Moderate Alignment,,,,,
"And so they're looking for some simplified unit of equal measurement. And you know what I see over here is comparable to what I see over there. And it’s not trying to break everything down to say “OK, that's specific to Tesco. That's specific to Sainsbury's”. They're looking for this broader scope. Then they see it all in one place and it's nice and easy. And there's some special little widget in the back that does all the hard work for them, and they just plug it in and play. And that's kind of where they're at… taking the workload away.",Automation, Expectations, Metrics, Sainsburys, Tesco, Standardisation & transparency, High Alignment,,,,,,
"I genuinely believe there's access to more money with more insights. And not fluffy insights that's just kind of like “Oh, here's a bit of extra information”. But the insights that make them be able to kind of go back to the business. Like we were talking about, lap shoppers and stuff. I used to work at Dunnhumby [and] I used to have a brand that focused very heavily on the lap shoppers. They’re completely different marketing part of budget for those people that because we could isolate who they were when they were able to access new funds and new funnels.

"Then you've got your kind of your traditional medias. Money is split so trickily that as a brand manager or as a marketing manager, you have to have justification for everything to move those [funded] pots about. And I think if it was possible to showcase the real depth of insight information for digital, they'd be able to move funds a lot easier out of traditional streams of marketing and bring it over [to retail media].

"It's interesting you say how they're not ready to take on more. And I wonder is that because they don't know where to begin or how to begin or kind of where to go next, I guess from sponsored ads?",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Do you know what I think? It's funny, when you break down EMEA [Europe, Middle East and Africa], right. With all of the UK guys, sponsored product Ads was the first thing that we did. And we as an onboarding team we always recommend start with sponsored product Ad. We know it's the quick win. You know, it's the easy one. We know the revenues are there.",Sponsored Product Ads (SPA), EMEA, Advice and guidance, Business norm, Revenue, High Alignment,,,,,,,
"When you look over to the mainland European scope of it, they’re only just focusing on display because they're not even ready for a sponsored product Ad. So I think you're right. I think there is an element of hesitation because they've got comfortable in this safe space of sponsored product Ad. It's very unintrusive. It's very easy to navigate through. It doesn't wildly disrupt the customer journey. And then taking the next steps they would really want to have kind of, not necessarily case studies of such, but a real rationale to say “This is why you go next”.",Business norm, Concern or Worry, Europe, High Alignment,,,,,,,,,
"Now we're trying to work with the CS [Client Support] team here in the UK and EMEA [Europe, Middle East and Africa] to kind of bolster, not their sales pitch approach, but being able to really bolster their knowledge then they can take that insights in.",EMEA, UK,,,,,,,,,,,
"I think we are about to enter a world where the digital landscape is going to break quite open. And depending on how quickly we can move, we can be looking at the digital in-stores. We can be looking at the emails, the newsletters, and we've got the off-site pieces. All those things. And it's like “OK, where where's the next less invasive high money area? Somebody tell me what to do”. And I think we're not even clear on what those spaces are. And again like we've always known, what that looks like for APJ [Asia-Pacific and Japan] versus the Americas versus EMEA [Europe, Middle East and Africa] is very different. Like the engagement levels and stuff are super, super different. I think they [AdManager regional teams] should be ‘hand holding’.",Email programs, In-store, Asia, EMEA, USA, Support & guidance, High Alignment,,,,,,
"Well, it's super interesting because it's the recurring theme that we're kind of hearing. Where's that education piece? Kind of like knowledge portal where we [retailers and brands] can kind of absorb all of what retail media has to offer and then make a decision based on all that information. And I guess the signposts of where the head and where to go and what to do next.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yeah, it's definitely something like this. I mean, it's amazing that you've got these case studies and these studies coming out and stuff like that. It would be really useful for us to just even just to see kind of like a summary of all of them, because I think it's interesting for us to know the direction that it's taking.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And Vicky [Foster], thank you so much for jumping on just to give you really, really quick context and I will take you through properly afterwards. Colin, Nate and Jimmy are just working through kind of the what’s next in retail media and where we kind of start to put our main focus is basically. And guys if I get this wrong stop me and but what they've been working on is they've been looking within the industry at lots of studies that are coming out and just wanted to get our thoughts on those studies. In particular to see whether what we're seeing here in the UK aligns. But also, if there's anything over and above that we would discuss and with me heading out in November.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Whilst I appreciate there’s still a few months, I wanted to bring you in as well, just so you can kind of add a layer to this. But also with Nectar360 being the way that they are and the drivers that they are, I think it's useful that you probably hear a lot of different noise to necessarily what I would as well. So you can add another layer to this as well. So moving forward we’ll make sure you’re included in all of these as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
That’s a great question. I think that definitely Nectar360 would be a massive advocate for that because I think there's definitely a gap [in expertise]. Even in terms of like the people they're hiring. They can't hire the right people to fill these gaps. I think one of the things that we try to do at AdManager is more and more training. But I think [that] the accreditation piece that we're doing in the UK will help.,Knowledge gap, Staffing or Resourcing, Training, Nectar360, High Alignment,,,,,,,,
"It's hard, isn't it? Because most of the people that we already work with are already kind of quite digital savvy. However, you've got we've got a couple of different challenges.

So I'll slice it up because I think the UK is a little bit further forward [in retail media expertise] than mainland Europe.",Europe, UK, High Alignment, Business challenge, Capability and expertise,,,,,,,,
"We've got two different types of retailer[s] here because we've got the bricks and water, but then we've got a solo online only. And what we‘re finding, the hesitancy to move is actually much bigger from the one that is solo digital because they have nowhere else to find that revenue bucket from. So if they scale everything into being digital and they move everything across into things like display or they move it into auction or they move it out of what they're doing in the agreed JBP’s [Joint Business Plans], they have risked a revenue is enormous and they have no way to backfill it. Whereas Tesco and Sainsbury's, Waitrose, they have a little bit more of a “OK, we'll give it a go and we'll listen to what you're saying and we'll take your approach because if we lose it here, we're probably recoup it over there”.",Concern or Worry, Sainsburys, Tesco, Waitrose, Reactive vs Proactive, Partners, Retailers, Moderate Alignment,,,,,
Now that's not going to last forever because POS [Point-Of-Sale] in-store is changing and people aren't as interested in that. [What] we used to do here in the UK were big wild events and a lot of retailers are kind of coming back from it saying can't do that because of health and safety and the COVID restrictions that were in place. And they are losing money through experiential as well as POS and then make this move into digital makes it tricky.,Complexity, In-store, UK, Low Alignment,,,,,,,,,
"If you go into Europe the ecommerce side of stuff is not as advanced anyway. So if we think about Nectar360, they do on average, I think it's 700,000 basket deliveries a week (and Vicky or tell me if I've got that wrong). Carrefour who we're working for is one of the biggest retailers in France does about 35,000 [baskets a week]. The scope and the difference is enormous.",eCommerce, Carrefour, Nectar360, Europe, Retailers, Moderate Alignment,,,,,,,
"They [traditional retailers like Carrefour] have a lot more pressure on making sure that in store looks perfect and it's pristine. Their focus onto digital isn't the same. They're kind of tentative with their steps. But they know that they've got it there [revenue with in-store].

Because it just looks so different.",Concern or Worry, In-store, Revenue, Carrefour, Retailers, Business challenge, Regional, High Alignment,,,,,
"And I think as well for me, from a UK perspective, I think just so traditionally when we're thinking about retailers, a lot of time, it's the buyers telling the brands what they should be investing in, where they should be spending their money. And because it's been for such a long time, it's in the store. They know in store, they know what to do. They know how to report it and that sort of stuff. When they think about digital, even the people and the client managers and team, they're sort of like “It's all just a bit confusing. It's all a bit much. It's easy for me to stick an aisle in the store and charge them tons of money and not be incredibly open about in terms of the return on it as well”.",Knowledge gap, In-store, Brands, Retailers, UK, High Alignment,,,,,,,
"I think it's trying to move the buyers with the retailers into this digital space as well as just the even just the people selling it to brands as well. I think also in terms of companies and the way they set up their teams. We are seeing more and more people becoming like ecomm specialists and they're moving a lot of their money to agencies to start to manage it.

"What they're trying to find within retailers when they try and back-fill these positions is somebody that can straddle both [traditional and digital]. And as Vicky says at the moment isn't commonplace. Like even when we're [AdManager] trying to find client managers to come in and direct our accounts. You have to choose the priority of one or the other. You're not going to get both, and I think to Vicky's point, it's absolutely right.",Retailers, High Alignment, Capability and expertise,,,,,,,,,,
"Again, like we're going back to Dunnhumby, I'd come from digital. Digital was kind of my space, but 70% to 80% of the people within the business when I moved into Dunnhumby had been there so long that digital was just a side pocket [not a main focus]. And it didn't mean anything, and it didn't do anything, and they didn't really understand it.",Knowledge gap, Dunnhumby, High Alignment,,,,,,,,,,
"So as Vicky says, the money was going into aisle offerings and stuff because there was revenues. And we almost need to showcase how easy it is to unlock that digital stuff. To be able to kind of open the door properly and open those revenue streams [in retail media]. But there's not enough people with the confidence, the knowledge and even just the mindset to sell it at the moment in the industry. And I think that's hopefully expanding, but it's going to take time. It's going to take a good five years before we get there.",Knowledge gap, Staffing or Resourcing, High Alignment,,,,,,,,,,
"I think it's interesting because they stick to what they know and what's easy, right? They're getting money in. They know where it's going to come from. They know where to put it.

"Now here in the UK and it will be the same as we start to move across EMEA a bit more. But because we are a technology provider, not an agency ourselves, they [agencies] really struggle to understand why we can't just sit and project plan with them and why we're not setting out budget lines and why we're not kind of doing a full forecast and stuff like that.

So it's trying to manage that sort of expectations with them because for them [agencies] it's easy to spend on Amazon - because Amazon just does whatever. But I think they do recognise obviously the need that they have to be spending [budget] on these retailers.,Spend, Amazon, Agencies, High Alignment,,,,,,,,,
"But I used to work for retailers, and I know they're not the easiest to work with. I think their expectations are hugely high as to what retailers will and won't do.

"They’re [brands] getting smarter. So with the likes of Pacvue and Skai now they're starting to see [metrics], and they want to see all the retailer’s data and at once. They now have the ability to get a bit smarter. The problem we have is that Sainsbury's are the only ones that open to Pacvue and Skai.

"They're [retailers] not listening to the brands necessarily. That's not the feedback that's coming back from the brands [i.e. around personalisation].

"Yes, there's a lot less resistance than there than there used to be. So, for most of my experience with retail media, it's like it, it wasn't known. It was kind of a… I would call it a side hustle. So every role that I had, I was buried underneath the marketing team or buried underneath an eCommerce team.",eCommerce, Value or belief, High Alignment,,,,,,,,,,
"And retailers are like “It's merchandising and operations and that's it”. They rule everything and so marketing is a cost centre and eCommerce is unprofitable. So if you run a business, even if it's profitable, you know, so you're making a couple million or 10, 20, 30 million [dollars] a year… you're kind of a rounding error. You're kind of on the outskirts of the what really the business is, which is procuring products, putting them on shelves and then selling them the customers.",Value or belief, Retailers, High Alignment,,,,,,,,,,
"And so that's been the kind of legacy of retail media. It wasn't clearly defined. It conflicted a lot of like shopper marketing or trade marketing or vendor allowance, co-op spend. Like all that stuff. So, it was really more of a nuisance than anything else.",Budget, Spend, High Alignment,,,,,,,,,,
And what's changed is now the retail media is kind of broken through. And the numbers are material. It’s like the revenue is big. The first study that came out said it's going to be $50 billion or $60 billion by 2025.

"Yeah. Well, I think for the for the retailers that are still heavy brick and mortar, there is only so much they can do. And either they aren't monetising their physical space, or they are and they've kind of maxed it out. Like shelf Ads or cart Ads, or in store radio, or digital signage.

"And what I see is - not everybody - customers aren't ready. They're not going to have 100% eCommerce penetration or 80% or probably even 50% anytime soon.

Like they can do that.",Digital channels, Marketing, Revenue, High Alignment,,,,,,,,,
"But what we're finding is are getting more creative. Like one retailer we work with, they used to have a loyalty program that had no digital aspect at all. It was all print coupons and postcards and, you know, mailers and that kind of thing. What they've done is they've now shifted to all the offers have to be loaded digitally.

They do all their communications by email instead of through postcard.",Anecdotal, Digital channels, Email programs, Marketing, Good offering, Retailers, Moderate Alignment,,,,,,

"So I think more and more retailers are starting to put those worlds together so they can connect the plumbing.

We both use the same base data to do our things, but there wasn't a lot of correlation between what we do.",Value or belief, High Alignment,,,,,,,,,,,
So I think that's where retailers are going to continue to lean in on that as more digitisation of their business. And so like digital circular. There's always been digital circulars like Flipp in the US. Like Flipp is on every digital circular there is on every grocery website. But it's still only used by digitally engaged customers.,Retailers, Digital channels, Flipp, USA, Moderate Alignment,,,,,,,,
"But like Kroger's announced [in April 2023], they're not doing a [weekly printed] circulars anymore.

And I assume that they make that decision knowing that it's going to pay off.",Digital channels, Kroger, Moderate Alignment,,,,,,,,,,
"There's a lot of risk in doing that to sales, but they're going to create more digitally engaged shoppers, which is going to help fuel their monetisation business.

"It completely is. Even though more and more money is going to retail media, a lot of that shifting out of shopper marketing like some of it's coming out of trade.

My thought is that like Pacvue and the Skai’s and the [retail media] buying platforms that help facilitate buys across multiple networks is probably the winning idea.

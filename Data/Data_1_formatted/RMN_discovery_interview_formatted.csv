So let me know where you want to start.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I'll start with one thing guys, just because I've met a lot of retailers in the last while as well. I'm also pitching to retailers myself. And just as more to get everybody on the same page. Because this won't change is my view, OK. Is that there is a continuum. And, the continuum is obviously [a] I don't have a retail media network to – particularly US when I'm already up and running in this sort of in terms of market segments. It's like I don't have a retail media network, but I don't even know anything about the tech right. Up to [b] I’m up and running; I know what it is that I'm thinking about the tech. And so that's why generic questions don't work. Because what I find when I'm talking to the retailers, they're very specific – specifically falling into those buckets. And even then within the buckets like, one individual may be the kind of like proselytiser [change advocate] in the organisation or you know they they've put their neck on the line, but the others don't know what it is. So they got to do a big as you know an internal kind of sales pitch. So one has to ask in terms of the three sales, the three buckets is, is my starting point always. I said 3 buckets, but it could be 4 buckets, i.e. customer segments.",Tiers (customers), Ad Tech, Retailers, Expertise,,,,,,,,
I'm referring to retailers.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So the answer is different in each case. And then the answer is also different obviously, as you guys know, am I talking about grocery here, or am I talking about you know somebody selling electronics. Because then obviously the CPG drives it, and so on. I'll give you a specific reason and then I'll shut up and then we can get to the questions.",Retailers, CPG (Consumer Packaged Goods), FMCG,,,,,,,,,
"So there's a company called the Very Group, which if anybody has ever been to the UK would know them as Littlewoods and they changed their name as from Littlewoods to Very. And they have been our client for about six months. And they do 1.4 billion [Sterling] online and there's a mix within there. So they've got electronics, clothing, furniture, and some other stuff. OK. So it's a real mix. It's kind of a department store online. It’s more like a Kmart – Australian style – or a Target Australian style that Target American style. And they don't really figure they're going to have much action on the electronic [products] side. They're going to have a lot of more action on the fashion side. And, why is this? Well, because Apple and Samsung run tell; them what to do and don't give them any more money and they will rule the roost. And I found the same with the Warehouse Group in New Zealand where they're like “No, no, we get told what to do on the electronic side”.",Retailers, Fashion, Business challenge,,,,,,,,,
"But when you move into fashion, it's so fragmented then it's a different answer. And therefore from your side, [the] functionality changes. Because obviously the sponsored search, sponsored product is not as important on that. And then you move into a different zone around sponsored display and other sort of high-end products. So that's why when we're asking questions, you have a 2 stepper in your head. You got to have [1] what's the segment, and [2] how advanced is that retailer segment. And then who are their suppliers and how does that drive it? Do you see what I'm saying?",Retailers, Banners, Business challenge, Expertise, Tiers (customers), SPA (Sponsored Product Ads),,,,,,
"They would have a lot of long-tail accessories, and I think there's a lot of opportunity in the accessory side. But what happens is they get a bit nervous. They're like “Well this is not going to work on sponsor products, and we can't really sell them any display. And we can't really sell money kind of high-end creative”. Because they're like “No”. But the accessories is different, obviously. You know, telling you you're going to say something.",Retailers, Fashion, Future opportunity, Business challenge,,,,,,,,
"I kind of stepped back a bit and I’ll kind of tell you some of the interests we had. I'm head of design and Nate's one of the product designers. And we’ve kind of taken a step back from the typical product feature and a usual product strategy. We've actually moved back into looking at ecosystem trends or themes I should say. So themes are kind of human behaviour themes that kind of affect the industry rather than a feature and that. And there's two there's two really big areas that I kind of want to talk to you [about]. And again it's kind of segmented into different buckets, because it doesn't hold true that just because you're a big retailer you've expertise. We're finding there's a mix up between big retailers like lots of expertise; lots of digital literacy around RMN’s. And others that are like massive and I'm talking billion dollar turnover… massive, and they're just struggling. So size doesn't make any difference.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"But the one area that I want to talk about there is something that came up really quite a lot in the UK and Europe and the States is this tension around funds. And this tension around funds being moved out of trade funds into online and a little bit of resistance from retailers around that. And we found that there's two big drivers from the brands. So what the brands want, is they want sales and they want acquisition – new audience. And what the retailers want is to cover the cost of their investment in tech. And those two things don't sometimes line up. So that's probably the first area I really want to dig into. What you're finding around that tension piece. And I read your Remade paper around how brands are now questioning the investment with they're kind of saying well with the lack of transparency and lack of metrics and that, they’re kind of saying “Should we pick the top three or four RMN’s. So should we pick an Amazon and Walmart and just invest them and forget about the rest of them. Because all the rest of them kind of shout to give us money. So they take like the top five sure bets”.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Can we hold that note Mark because that's a thing on its own. But they're both great points. So this is a topic that I've spent and listened and researched like a lot on the first one. So just a framing for you, is again just like the retailers are in different segments, there's actually a thing that I couldn't figure out for a while. It took us working with a number of retailers to work this out. It's a very simple sort of metaphor which is like there are retailers who are traders and there are retailers who are strategic.",Retailers, Business strategy, Tiers (customers),,,,,,,,,
"Now if you take say Superdrug who's our client – they're part of the AS Watson Group in out of Hong Kong. And they run like Marionnaud in France and in Austria. And they run, I forgot, the largest tech chemist chain... pharmacy chain in Holland. And they're so trading, you wouldn't believe. It's all deals, deals, deals. Get them in, get them out. Everything's health and beauty… even though it’s health and beauty, it's get them in get them out. Whereas you look at Boots and you look at Tesco and you meet their chief execs. In each case they're like strategic and the same for The Very Group [Littlewoods] they're strategic. So there's a continuum. And so I would say to anybody's trying to sell tech into these guys, you've got a know where they are in the continuum, are they strategic, [or] are they just pile them high. Because the tactical guys like say like a Superdrug… typically the senior management is built like that because they come from a trading background. So the most important thing is the profile of the senior management, are they there in the organisation for a long time. Are they you know trading types. Typically they'll come from trade. So that's number one.",Asia, Trade marketing/spend, Business challenge, Ad Tech, Health & Beauty, Pharmacy, Business strategy, Retailers,,,,
"Number two, associated with that back to your point Mark, is typically they're trade money is how they make money. OK, so if you take say one of the things I do – I don't think I did it in Remade [publication] but I do it a good few other things – I put up a list of the margins for all the major grocery retailers across the globe on the screen. And it's like 2.7 [percent] to 3.2 [percent] with a lot of negative. And there's essentially no margin in retail. And retail only earn their money through trade for the most part. And that shouldn't really come as a surprise to us, but it still is kind of surprising. I kind of knew it. And then, hold on a second, I didn't think it was as low as that. And those margins are going down, They're not going up.",Trade marketing/spend, Business challenge, Revenue, Grocery, Business norm, Retailers,,,,,,
"So if that's the case, then this tension within the retailer is necessary otherwise the business goes belly up. And so when you're in there pitching, you've got to think through which are these guys. I mean guys in the widest sense because if they're traders, immediately that's going to kick the decision out and it's going to push things out. Because the people involved, their incentives are not aligned to considerable retail the network. Because immediately when they're talking to you – and I must have interviewed about 50 people in who were trying to set up retail media networks over the last year and a half. And this is how they speak because they’re in the moment talking about deals, deals, deals. And you're like well, you know networks and blah, blah, blah, and sponsored search, and you know and here's how to think about this And I'm technology agnostic and they're just like, yeah, yeah, whatever. How are we going to get more money off these guys in the trade side?",Retailers, Knowledge gap, Ad Tech, Operations, Tiers (customers), Trade marketing/spend, Mental models,,,,,
"So they're entrenched in their thinking that you can't break them out because they're incentives aren't there. They're never going to change their incentives. Our clients Superdrug finally went live yesterday, the 15th of November. We started dealing with some January 2002. And his biggest problem was not that it was a bad idea, was because the chief exec was like “Oh, I buy in technology to do what? Because I already get money from the suppliers”. And so they haven't kind of pivoted it in their head to those days are over. And it's one of the things when I'm talking in detail, particularly in my socials, when I do go and say like can you not see. I'm talking marketing people don't see it either which is like those days are over. There is no CFO in L’Oreal, [or] Unilever that are going to say “You know what we should keep doing. We should just keep shovelling cash into this business under the guise of trade money and never get anything back”. Because they don't, Superdrug told me, straight up. What information do you give them? Nothing. Why do you not give me information? Because it sucks. Like if they do a CRM e-mail blast, it costs 30 grand [$30k] and they get no sales. That's true for everybody.",Pharmacy, Brands, Knowledge gap, Retailers, Business challenge, Missed opportunities, Business norm, Mental models,,,,
"Now, one of the things I do as my side hustle, I do a lot of teaching and training. And one of the things I've done a lot of teaching and training in is e-mail marketing. Because I was head of marketing for an airline. And we had 300,000 [customers] on our database. So I know how to run e-mail campaigns. If you can't get a sale out of an e-mail campaign in health and beauty, you're an idiot. And obviously I don't say this to the clients, but I'm like “What? You don't get any sales at all from your CRM?”. It turns out that's run by a bunch of people who don't know jack shit about e-mail [campaigns], and they just sell them the slot. So they're not that interested in creating value for the supplier. They're interested in getting money off the supplier. So, am I answering your question a little bit there because what I want to move on to the brand and shopper stuff.",Opportunity, Knowledge gap, Training, Advice and guidance, Sales, Email programmes,,,,,,
"Yeah because it came up that, when we found out the industry themes, we went through about 50 industry papers and did a meta-analysis. Then we interviewed our VP’s on 4 continents and look, this is what we're hearing. And they said “Yeah, we're kind of hearing the same”. There's some guys [brands and retailers] are great. Like you say, the strategic guys. They're not thinking about immediate money. They're thinking about that long-tail growth like build audience, build awareness, build the experience and then look at the revenue coming in. As opposed to the guys who are going to go “Yeah, where's the money tomorrow and let's squeeze the brands for more money now”. And it's a really funny one because, I thought it might be just the small guy. But it's rife through-out the industry. There is no [common] profile.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"It's retailers [behaviour]. And the mad bit is the same in Latin America, it's the same in Turkey, it's the same in Ireland, it's the same in Australia. The one place that's not quite as prevalent as the US. But it's still prevalent.",Mental models, Routine activity, Retailers,,,,,,,,,
"Again within the brands, you see you're haven’t been that person on both sides of the fence because I used to be Head of Marketing and retail, and I was also the supplier. If you've got what I call market power – Nestle, Procter & Gamble – you can kind of say that. But everybody else forget it. It's like [from retailers] “Do you want the listing or not? Yes or no?”.",Brands, Business challenge,,,,,,,,,,
"And these trading folks as you know are they're not exactly like the… – they’re deliberately hired to be assholes, you know. I'm looking at some quotes I got, so I'll be able to kind of give you those quotes in a second. But it's like, if you're at the top ten [brands] in the world, even still you can't kind of really mess around. Now even within that as you know, the supplier, they’re dealing with an account manager [on the retailer side]. They're not dealing with a brand guy. Well it's a brand gal typically because most of the marketing and these organisations run by brands, their senior management is marketing is all female – around the globe like New Zealand, Australia, Ireland. So the brand folks [are] on that. The shopper folks are removed from this picture and there are just dealing with the trade folk. And the brand guys – because I come from this background – don't want to be kind of fumbling in the greasy till of actual commercial deals. They want to flute around [focus] with TV campaigns. Mark, I think I might have hopefully tried to answer that for you there.",Brands, Trade marketing/spend, Account management, Retailers, Shopper marketing/spend, Brand marketing/spend,,,,,,
"Let me give you an example within Superdrug. So within Superdrug, they're second-tier brand is one called Revolution Makeup, or something like that. But this is one of these kind of new hip [brands] –  I'm obviously not target market for the makeup game. But one of these new hip makeup brands over the last five years – completely different to L’Oreal or whatever. And they've grown. They were like nothing 10 years ago. Now they're 200 million [dollars in revenue]. And, if they're selling into Superdrug, all they care about is distribution because that's what happens in at the point-of-sale. So if they [Superdrug] say “Give us money”, they're like, “Yeah, great, no problem”. Because they [brand] can't afford TV. They don't have market power. Now it's a different scale. I've talked to CVS in the US when I was there, and they've got like some ridiculous amount of stores – like 9000 stores, but even them, they're not that good in the tech stack. And the main problem is their internal machinations is not desire to go do stuff. And also the brands at that scale, it's not even about market power. It's because there isn't one central person running everything, Do you know what I mean? Because it's just too big.",Brands, Retailers, Cosmetics, Business challenge,,,,,,,,
"Even I can't find them half the time. And the person in SuperValu in Ireland, it took three months to find out [the right contact person] and like it shouldn't take that difficult. It was only through a contact that I found out. So Mark, what was the second question again?",Business challenge,,,,,,,,,,,
"The second one is around the decision making around how to spend and some of them have gone “It's like it's too hard, there's too much. I'll just pick the top five”. Especially in the States. It's going like “I’ll just go to Amazon”.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"So again I got to state the obvious, but it's just to make sure because you always kind of have to get everybody on the same page. I think. So the way to think about it is media is always bought locally. So what happens in Spain, stays in Spain. In other words, if I'm a brand in Spain, I'm buying in Spain. I've run pan-European campaigns on TV and all that sort of stuff. We never ever did cross-border stuff. The media buying agencies cannot in in London, cannot buy in France. They don't do it. It's just not possible. And so, when it comes to that statement about like, how do we choose, you actually have to think about it purely on a local basis. So if I'm in Turkey and you say, how do I choose? Well, there is no choice because there's Hepsiburada and there's Migros or Mimada, and there's one other whose name I can't pronounce. That's it. You know, if you want to do fast delivery, it's get here. That's it. There's no other choices for you to use retail media.",Agency, Business norm, Media buying, Regional,,,,,,,,
"So you have to kind of split it out by country, and you cannot make this error of the brand don’t know how to choose. Because there might be “A” no choice or “B” the one filter on this is that Amazon is not that mature. Say for instance in Australia it's not that mature. So therefore the issue of who do I choose just doesn't come up.",Media buying, Brands, Amazon, Business challenge,,,,,,,,
"Now, in the US, it's a thing [choosing only the top RMN’s]. It's definitely a thing “How do I choose between all the retailers out there?”. Well, the answer becomes pretty straight-forward, because you're either lazy and you just say “Right, we can only deal with three or four and that's it”. Or particularly if you're vertically focused – like if you're L’Oreal – you're going to have to deal with Ulta [Beauty], whether you like it or not. And so you can't go and say “Well, I'm only dealing with Amazon, Target, you know, Walmart and Kroger because they're my biggest ones”. Well, no, I can do better deals with Ulta.",Health & Beauty, Brands, Walmart,  L'Oreal, USA, Cosmetics, Target, Business norm, Amazon, Kroger, Media buying,
"By the way, this is one of the things we say to retailers that we're dealing with is you need to have a positioning in the market that's compelling. You can't just go and launch a retail media network, which sounds obvious to you guys, but you'd be amazed. You know, basic marketing 101. So it is a thing [spending only within the top RMN’s]. But I would primarily think like that with your hat on in the US and only a little bit in the UK. And like if you were said to me that in France, I'd be like well like look at the, look at the market power of Carrefour, Amazon, who else, say Auchan and so on. Then that's a different question. So it's definitely local [media buying] discussion every time.",Business strategy, Advice and guidance, Retailers, Europe, USA, UK,,,,,,
"And also just as an aside, like we've found it difficult in breaking into France. And I should know this because they used to be the head of marketing for a big telco brand of France. And it's like what happens in France is in France, you know. It's just the way it is. And that's because the media business, as you know, being owned by Publicis is super powerful. Did that answer that Mark?",Publicis, Europe, Business challenge,,,,,,,,,
It did. Yeah. Thanks for that.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I'm going to read you out some things. I'll give you a two stories that might help you, OK. So I did a long workshop with a couple of brands just in the last four or five months. Even for me, working with the retailers is a bit challenging because they take so long to make the decisions and they don't realise that they've going to have a problem and I think it's just about installing tech.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"So who take, say, the conversation I had a Luxembourg with Ferraro. And Ferraro is not just Ferraro Rocher, but also Nutella and they've just bought this huge biscuit brands in the UK, United Biscuits. And they've bought… they've got a tonne of brands that you go, “Oh yeah, I know those all those brands”. And there was 100 people from the e-commerce team in the room and what their problem was there were different levels of capability within the e-commerce teams around the globe. So guess what, the US team is experts. So they end up having the US team talking, and they had the UK team talking. But everybody else is sitting there going what's going on? And the Chinese guy sitting on his phone, as usual. Because the Chinese guys are like “What the hell are we talking about here guys? This is stuff I was doing five years ago”. So within the organisations they [brands] have a capability challenge and then subset to that, the penetration of eComm or e-retail in particular is, is not as you think it's going to be.",Expertise, Knowledge gap, UK, Asia, Brands, eCommerce marketing/spend, Advice and guidance,,,,,
"So for instance, in Spain, Portugal, Italy and France, as the guys from Colgate told me, as soon as COVID went away, everybody went back to the stores and stopped buying online because they want to see the products and they want to be able to touch and feel the products. And so you're like, OK, so you're back to the big countries, the France’s and you know, Germany and so on. So they [Colgate] told me specifically that the retail media investment across all markets has delivered a total ROAS of 400%. As a result, retail media will go from 4% of Total Media spend in 2021 to 9% of total spend in 2023. And they're getting a 2.27 ROAS. But the only way they can measure – $2.27 – the only way they were able to measure that was to MMM [Marketing Mix Modelling] in the US, only on Amazon.",Europe, Brands, Amazon, Performance, ROAS, Budget, USA, Business growth, Buyer behaviour, Spend,,
"So from your perspective, this is where we kind of shift over to the brand discussion. The brands are under pressure to show our ROI, ROAS across channels, for reasons I'll talk about in a second. And it's important. But, they can't measure across channels correctly. And the only one who has the data for long enough is Amazon. So they end up using Amazon as the benchmark for better, for worse, you know. Then we talk say this is L’Oreal, by the way. L’Oreal are taking a global approach with on-site teams, bidding teams and programmatic teams. A retailer has to work with all three [L’Oreal] teams as well as the brand team. So L’Oreal are a pain to deal with for a lot of the brands because they're all over this. I know Lex Zanger Bradshaw [Chief Marketing & Digital Officer, L'Oréal South Asia Pacific, Middle East & North Africa] out of Singapore quite well because he got me into the [Retail Media] training. And he said it was very interesting how hard-ass they were. They were like “Those retailers!”. And the reason he was able to speak like that is, of course, if you look at the L’Oreal brands, they got market power. Yeah, they got stuff people want. And so they're aggressive on this because they know their power in the market.",Metrics, Data challenge, eCommerce marketing/spend, Brands, On-site,  L'Oreal, Business growth, Business challenge, ROAS, Training, ROI, Amazon
"Well let's look at Beiersdorf. So Beiersdorf have basically moved everything into in-house. They've gone completely enhanced retail media, but they still believe their agencies. So they know it's part of the overall comms plan. So this is weird dynamic. Beiersdorf want to run retail media in-house – particularly sponsored products, sponsored display. And then they go to their own media agency and say “Hey guys, this is what we're doing. You might want to think about it in your plans that we've already briefed”. So that's a complete inversion of how the world used to work.",Agency, Banners, Business strategy, Brands, SPA (Sponsored Product Ads),,,,,,,
"Coty [quote that Fred read], “We see real opportunity to drive precision marketing and drive closed loop measurement. We're setting up a best-practise Centre of Excellence in Paris, where the local radio media managers feed in”. Back to L’Oreal. The retail media is in their case is on-site search and it the actual retail media manager job in the retailer is very, very difficult because you've got to wrangle budget from each of these teams and sort them all out amongst themselves. So again, from the retailer's perspective, life isn't easy for them once they set up the retail media network. Each supplier has their own MO [Modus Operandi – ways of working] and they got to think about the world through each individual suppliers MO in order to hit their budget targets. But typically what's happened is they've [retail media manager] been told to hit a target and then they've got to go “Oh my God, I've got to have like 30 different discussions at 30 different drug business plans”.",Business challenge, Health & Beauty, On-site, Business growth, Brands,  L'Oreal, Retailers, Budget,,,,
"I've got one more thing on that one. The one who we're all finding the easiest to deal with is Unilever. Unilever’s all in on this [retail media]. And they've got very good teams around the globe on this and a real softly, softly on the whole thing. They're like “Let's work together, you know, blah, blah, blah”. So they're all over it [the opportunity]. So they also love fast delivery. Are you guys in fast delivery? Are Quick Delivery much?",Delivery services, Unilever, eCommerce marketing/spend, Business strategy, Brands,,,,,,,
"Yeah, all those guys, are you in there?",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Just again from the perspective of you know, it's a belt and braces. The Unilever’s and Pepsi’s [brand types] and people of this world, they like this fast delivery. And because all of these fast delivery things are new opportunities to sell. New opportunities to for the customer to buy. So me, sitting on a sofa on a Friday night vegging out going through Netflix. He's too much of A lazy bastard to get up off the sofa and go to the fridge and put on the oven. Instead gets on his phone and goes [click, click, click] and orders something in. And that person on the phone is a different person to the person who goes to the local shop. And so they spend more, and they'll throw in ice-creams, and they'll throw in this. Or I'm working in the office, and I say “Hey, it's boiling hot, get in the ice-creams. But, everybody's too lazy to go downstairs and go get the ice-cream. So they'll deliver. And so these new opportunities to purchase mean that the fast delivery, quick delivery is here to stay. And actually I think the Ad opportunity in that in sponsored product response to display is actually bigger, if you will, for the for the suppliers compared to say grocery where it's kind of like a transactional big shop.",Buyer behaviour, SPA (Sponsored Product Ads), Banners, Future opportunity, Unilever, Delivery services, Pepsico,,,,,
"Yeah, it's a bigger cart. Where this one’s [fast delivery], a shorter, smaller car.t So you got the missions are different. Are you guys familiar with Unilever shopper missions? OK, you really should know this. Shopper Missions is a way to think about the world that Unilever did a couple of years ago and it's very, very clever. And you should start thinking about the world in that language. Hold on a second, I’ll see if I can find it for you. OK, I’ll find a good search for you. So write the words ‘Unilever Shopper Missions’ into Google. And Unilever identified shopper missions in order of popularity as [1] Top-up Food, [2] Food For Now – sandwiches, drink, some crisps. [3] Need It Now (Distress Items), [4] Newsagent – including newspapers and cigarettes, [5] Meal For Tonight, and there's also like big shop and stuff like that. And if you understand shopper missions, that ties directly into retail media. And the reason for that is all those shopper missions are transferred online in many respects. So our Meal For Tonight is a shopper mission. That is where there's a big opportunity for retail media. Need It Now – 30-minute delivery, and [Food] Top-up. Yeah, so the one [website] I found is only average. Do a little bit of poking around and you'll find the correct shopper missions [article].",Unilever, Delivery services, Buyer behaviour, Business strategy,,,,,,,,

"One thing that we picked up talking to our VP's in the States because they're they talked a lot. I think it's Flip and Instacart, specifically Instacart and that kind of delivery. But one thing they said was quite outstanding is sometimes the deals on Instacart aren't as good as in store, but people are still willing that convenience thing. So they they're not necessarily getting the best deals but getting the best convenience. So the price that the actual end consumers paying is actually higher than going in store and sometimes quite significantly higher.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yeah, that's the do with scale. Has anybody here been to the States recently.",,,,,,,,,,,,
Last one since about 2008.,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was there a couple of months ago.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I don't know what you thought, Jack, but I couldn't believe the price of everything. It's like, crazy. I mean, I've been asked to speak at the NRF [National Retail Federation event] in January in New York. And I told the guy, I said “Listen, I'm not going unless you pay for everything”.",,,,,,,,,,,,
Yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,
And it's not an exchange rate thing.,,,,,,,,,,,,
We paid $60.00 [USD] for like 2 burgers and the kids burger – and it was like $60.00 U.S. dollars. Like that's crazy.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"US dollars, yeah. OK, I was in Palo Alto, but I wasn't kind of going into a Louis Vuitton here, you know. I was going into a Starbucks, and $7.00 for a medium Americano. Now we're moaning in Dublin about a €4 Euro coffee. And you can go to Spain and buy the same coffee for €1.20. And let's say I go to Chicago, I had a burger and a beer at a bar. It's like $50. It's like “You having a laugh?”. And so it doesn't surprise me from the Instacart perspective that people are like, that doesn't matter that's more expensive. Because in the consumer's mind – with the shopper mission idea in play – they'd outsource that problem because the money is not relevant. It's hard for us to get our heads around that. My wife and I were just talking about this last night. She ordered in delivery there last night. We never order in delivery because I can literally walk to the shops and there's a store 5 minutes away. And I can cycle 5 minutes away. Like my life is completely different. I'm not driving anywhere. You know, in the US you've got to drive everywhere. But they also have a lot more money. Like a lot more money. Like salaries for some of these 27-year-old’s in the West Coast is 300 grand [$300k].",Buyer behaviour, Delivery services, InstaCart,,,,,,,,,

"The shopper, again to certain extent of customer segments. But the shopper is living on his phone – his or her phone – and that everything's available immediately like in China. Like if you're going out to dinner, you'll go on the app and you'll book it and you'll do it on the spot. And the price is kind of secondary, if you will. It's about the occasion and the thing and the mission. It's not about like the cost. Particularly in the big city. Because everything's expensive, even McDonald's.",Mobile, Buyer behaviour,,,,,,,,,,
"Does that mean from a relevance point of view, if you're Instacart and your Doordash’s are aggregating – like your relevance – as that becomes your more relevant touch-points for consumers and then your retailers are secondary, like why do I need to go into store. So the shift of the play comes from you're not coming into my [retail] walled space, but how am I going to be relevant in this new emerging marketplace where essentially the discount reduction on the bottom dollar, the shopping vouchers doesn't really matter anymore?",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Well, again in the US, one hesitates to make massive generalisations about the US because it's obviously a huge market and there's a lot of people who need those vouchers and stuff like that. But the people who are need the vouchers, they ain’t using Instacart. Do you know what I mean? It's around scale, you know. I did a deep dive on Instacart. I've got like a 30-page report on Instacart and most of the time I couldn't get my head around the fact that people get somebody else to do their grocery shopping and deliver it to them. Mainly because I’ve just no experiences like that. I hire a person on minimum wage to drive their car to go to the shop and buy stuff for me. What? If my mother heard that sort of thing, she'd give me a slap over the head. Like, why? You lazy bastard So I think when it comes to Instacart, you just have to kind of reframe your brain. And things like deals and vouchers, because I'm not there for that. It's like it's like moaning about the price of the wine when you're out on Valentine's night. It's probably not ideal, you know.

"Well, I've created a course for advertising week. I created two courses in retail media and besides the best practise stuff, I had to write whatever 18 months ago. So I've spent a lot of time noodling on the idea on these individual product sets and how to communicate to people. And again from stating the obvious, sponsored search is most of retail media – for the most part. And it is the most important part and the biggest revenue driver. But amazingly enough most people don't understand it, and they don't see that. And they see all this with the fancy stuff and they don't realise that for the most part 70% of retail media is sponsored search or product. In fact people I deal with end up having bloody theological discussions over should be called sponsored product to sponsored search. And I'm sitting going “What!”. It's like nuts.",Advice and guidance, Products, Business norm, Search terms / Keywords, Knowledge gap, SPA (Sponsored Product Ads), Revenue,,,,,
"Sponsored search is the equivalent of the smart guys in the US know they've got to be on that because that's equivalent to paying to be on the shelf. It's digital availability, mental, physical, digital availability all in one. So that's your always-on strategy, particularly in grocery. Because for my sins, I bought my first display advertising campaign in 2006 and I've always had a love, hate relationship with display. Even in kind of closed environments like say Facebook or retailers. And the reason is very simple… the click through rate always suck. Always. 100% of the time, always sucks. And what happened in the world of digital, people think that we're going to apply the same laws of gravity to every single type of digital Ad unit. And they don't cop [understand] that CTR's on digital display always sucked, and always will suck.",USA, Business strategy, Facebook, eCommerce marketing/spend, Ad Types, Retailers, CTR (Click Thru Rate), SPA (Sponsored Product Ads), Banners,,,
"So for instance, I used to run the ancillary revenue for an airline which is pretty much identical to many aspects of retail media, which is why I was interested in the first place. You get your confirmation page and we would know the CTR for each block of content. And we would know the results depending on the offer. You know, was there price-driven. We'd also know the results depending on the time before the flight. So today, there's no CTR. Three days to go, the CTR increases on that block of digital display, you know. So the way I pitch to people, I say always-on, get on the shelf, is [sponsored] search. Display is so for your contextual, for your sort of reinforcement and brand. But do not expect anything from that [like high CTR’s]. The newer richer stuff – kind of like what's Amazon are doing a sponsored brand video – is the way to go. Now, all the data that I've got here says that the brand video or sponsored video within the flow gets a higher CTR and better results and the brands love it. So within the realm of Amazon, they're all over video. And if I had a magic wand with you guys or with any vendor, I'd say “Guys, drop everything and make video work”. Because that [video] Ad unit is much more powerful than sponsored display.",CTR (Click Thru Rate), Amazon, Cost structure, SPA (Sponsored Product Ads), Digital video, Spend, Future opportunity, Banners,,,,

Let's just make a three-step funnel. Video – and again I have to tell you how much time I have spent thinking through this and talking to people over this – it's like a lot. Video works for awareness, Video works for consideration and video works for conversion. It works across the board. And all the data that's done through professors noodling around and issuing papers says exactly the same thing. At a certain level, it's better on consideration and awareness.

It's kind of nice but you know this [video opportunity] works. And you can develop your own creative that works at awareness and consideration right through the flow… looks amazing”. And then what that then does is – and this is the key point to note is – that then you're moving away from some discussion about how retail media is some bottom of the funnel thing, and the brand people get involved.

"So this is just a little bit of 30-second philosophy. Within a marketing department and within an Ad agency, there's a hierarchy and there's a status. And ‘status play’ is the game that's going on, but nobody will ever tell you this. And the status play is this. If you're the head of brand, you were the highest status person in the room. If you are the fingers on keyboards, AdWords guy, you're the bottom feeder and you're in the room with no windows. And so you've got this kind of perspective here. So when the brand folks are in the room, listen to this retail media thing, they're not hearing what you think they're hearing. They're hearing low-status channel versus high-status TV channel. I am never going to win a Cannes award if I go down this road here.",Future opportunity, Digital video, Brand marketing/spend, Gap (Product or Service),,,,,,,,
"And so it's like the world I call, it's like the commercial marketers versus the brand marketers. How do I know? I'll give you a specific example.

Why, when you could do the cool branded strategy stuff?”. This is this is how the world works guys.

"With the with this video, so there's one thing that's confusing to me. You see a lot of talk about video but then it's like is it, in the streaming site, Instream?",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Instream, 100%. It’s both [Instream and Outstream], but start with Instream.",Digital video,,,,,,,,,,,

"No, not on YouTube. So, if I'm say the retailer – forget that it's AdManager – imagine I'm working in retail media network. And I've got shopper [managers], trade brand [managers] to fight with. So I might be dealing with trade [funds]. And that's where maybe we should spend the last few minutes on talking about this tension between the 3 [shopper, trade and brand managers and spend]. We go and say right, I can walk in the door. And this is a real world, by the way, I'm not like every time our man in Superdrug goes and talks to Unilever, he comes back and gives us complete debrief. OK, so and here's how the conversation goes roughly. While I could box off – because they're selling media – he says “I could box off the sponsored search with Company X and company or brand Y”. And he’s like, “No, we're not going to do that. Get lost. We're not. We're never going to pay for that. We want to do display because we're obsessed with our brand”. And so he's barely achieving his targets with one company and then he's achieving his targets with another company because some of them love sponsored search and some of them love sponsored display.

And so, then they can take existing material like their Christmas campaign or whatever the case is and turn it into a snippet that maps to that.

"So with live shopping, huge in Asia but has not really taken off anywhere else because it's tied in with QVC and home shopping and it's low status.

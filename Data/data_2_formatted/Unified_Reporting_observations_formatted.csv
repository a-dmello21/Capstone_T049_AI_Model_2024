OBSERVATION,TAGS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Seeing some increasing strong competition in the market, and feel we need to closely monitor. Key competitors include PromoteIQ (acquired by Microsoft), Mirakl, and Criteo.",Competitor, PromoteIQ, Criteo, Mirakl,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mirakl are starting to impact AdManager by winning RFPs. Off-Site competitors are also starting to make impacts in the Retail Media market space. For example BrandCrush (recently acquired by Criteo),Competitor, Impact, Mirakl, BrandCrush, Criteo, Competitor advantage, Off-site,,,,,,,,,
"The Trade Desk is also moving into the Retail Media market-space with a platform that managed off-site media planning, and think they will also progress into on-site too. They have their own Unified ID 2.0.",The Trade Desk, Competitor, Off-site, On-site,,,,,,,,,,,,
Spoke about Criteo's recent announcement regarding development of a self-service platform (Commerce Max). He commented that there is not too much concern about this announcement as Criteo tend. to make big PR/Stakeholder announcements like this but still have the same product and dashboard with some new product features to activate. But very little real advances in a self-managed platform offering. These type of announcements are usually used to prop up earnings reporting in Criteo.,Competitor, Criteo, Self-serve,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Wanted to understand what our operational and reporting needs (on-site, off-site and in-store). Suggesting speaking to senior team members who use our platforms, and commented that meetings were being booked.",Follow-up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"There is no simple billing feature for retailers (even in the initial Unified platform) that can be self-served. If we provided a proper self-serve billing experience we would provide a much better experience than Criteo, whose billing system is still very manual.",Competitor, Self-serve, Gap (Product or Service), Manual effort, Criteo, Billing,,,,,,,,,,
Suggested offering features that would allow each brand to request 'on-the-fly' billing. This would create a strong differentiator between AdManager and it's competitors.,Competitor, Gap (Product or Service), Brands, Billing,,,,,,,,,,,,
Commented that self-managed billing is what Mirakl is proposing to the market and they are winning RFP's due to this feature announcement.,Competitor, Self-serve, Competitor advantage, Gap (Product or Service), Mirakl, Billing,,,,,,,,,,
"Commented that Mirakl are already integrated to the marketplace with features that strongly align to self-managed billing (i.e. API's for inventory management, orders and shipments, back-office integrations, payment workflows, etc). Also noted that Mirakl just need to tie their billing feature into media Campaigns and this would be a very appealing offer to retailer as it would tie directly into how they want to work.",Mirakl, API, Competitor, Self-serve, Competitor advantage, Gap (Product or Service), Billing,,,,,,,,,
Brands want to know where they are with their billing any time within a month. Potentially they could make a single request in the UI and get their latest up-to-date billing information. Brands and retailers will also require multiple currency support.,Brands, Brand needs, Self-serve, Billing, Retailers, Multi-currency, Support,,,,,,,,,
I can tell you this [multiple currency support] is coming; this is going to be a differentiator in the future.,Brands, Complexity, Data,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Good we have made a start with Advanced Reporting, and halo reporting. However, it is not really a differentiator as Criteo provides this already. But it is a necessary part of our  offering.",Consideration, Competitor, Reporting, Criteo, Positive feedback, Brand needs, Halo reporting, Retailer needs,,,,,,,,
"What will need to be different is the content and granularity of the future Advanced Reporting we will offer to brands and retailers. Recommend we do a comparative analysis to Criteo's reporting to (a) add an items for parity, and (b) add items that would provide us with a clear advantage.",Consideration, Follow-up, Future research, Reporting,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In Europe most needs have been for on-site reporting and commented that off-site reporting in AdManager still seems too 'theoretical' for brands and retailers at the moment. but feels when we release the full Unified UI reporting (on-site, off-site and in-store) we well get a number of activation request from brands and retailers.",In-store, Off-site, On-site, Reporting, Business challenge, AdManager, Brands, Retailers, Europe,,,,,,,
In-store reporting in the UK is something that the whole market is asking for; and it doesn't exist in the retail media platform space today. There is no single unified platform offering this disconnected dashboards or spreadsheet reports that brands and retailers have created themselves.,In-store, Opportunity, Reporting, Gap (Product or Service), UK,,,,,,,,,,,
"If we manage to really have off-site that includes in-store, and maybe in the future CTV [Connected TV devices - smart TV's, mobiles, tablets, etc. connected to streaming content - e.g. Amazon, YouTube, etc.]. That's going to be a massive differentiator in the market. It doesn't have to be too detailed. It doesn't have to have the advanced report features, I think. As long as there is the functionality there [to see all channels] and they can tie this to some of the major players in the market like JCDecaux [outdoor & billboard advertisers] and Clear Channel.",Consideration, Competitor, Future opportunity, In-store, Reporting, Amazon, Clear Channel, CTV (Connected TV), JDDecaux, Social media, Europe,,,,,
For in-store AdManager should first focus on digital screens and then look to fulfill all in-store advertising later on. Commented the US in-store market experience has a lot of deeper integrations and tends to be a very complex region for reporting. With the majority of retailer and brands in transformation to get matching product ID's for reporting.,Digital, Future opportunity, In-store, AdManager, Business strategy, Catalog (retailer), Integrations, Future challenge, USA,,,,,,,
Recommended starting with a simple in-store reporting view that would not be catering to advanced reporting at the start. This would enable AdManager to have something useful in market sooner. ,Recommendation, Consideration, Future opportunity, In-store, Reporting, Value-add, AdManager,,,,,,,,,
"Our current unified reporting dashboard has been created in order to provide free content. However, in the future commented we should identify and isolate features and content that would be classified as premium. And we should consider that activating these premium features and content would require a AdManager request.",Cost structure, Future opportunity, Reporting, AdManager,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If you were asking me... anything that relates to reporting, I don't think we should provide this for free at all. And there should be mentioned here and there [within the UI] of where we can help. There should be somewhere, let's say they [brand and retailers] want to optimise the campaigns; they want to get additional value out of the platform, there should be this message telling them we have the managed service as well. We do have the expertise.",Advice and guidance, Campaigns, Cost structure, Future opportunity, Managed service, Optimisation, Reporting,,,,,,,,,
Recommended including activation links [for premium features and support services] in the UI. AdManager sometimes over-serve our big clients in fear of losing their business. But this has knock-on effects for how we are perceived and working to our future roadmaps.,Cost structure, Future opportunity, Reporting, Managing expectations, AdManager,,,,,,,,,,,
"Confirmed multi-national brands are looking for a roll-ed view of earnings and market share across all regions. They want to benchmark global and regional performance - even if it not indexed. They want to visualise where they are. It is not only about revenue, but more about how successful is our organisation against our direct competitor. This is the number one ask from all large brands.",Performance, Revenue, Reporting, Bench-marking, Brand needs, Competitor data, Global, Regional,,,,,,,,
Commented that bench-marking insights should not be given away for free - as it is very crucial and expensive information to source. Questioned how involved should retailer be in terms of controlling the bench-mark data as these insights and data relates directly to the brands. [NOTE: Follow up conversation needed],Cost structure, Future opportunity, Bench-marking, Follow-up, Business decision, Retailers,,,,,,,,,,
"Do AdManager want the retailers to manage the relationship by being in the middle and serving this bench-marked information to brands, and make a margin on top. Or, do we want to sell directly to the brands; especially the Publicis brands.",Business decision, AdManager, Retailers, Bench-marking,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Also asked, if we sell reporting & benchmarked data directly to brands, then contractually how will this work with retailers where we would need to use their data.",Business decision, Data, Reporting, Brands, Retailers, Bench-marking,,,,,,,,,,
"Also need to consider advertising agencies (like WPP plc.) who are responsible for managing multiple brands on multiple retailer on-site experience. These agencies want to be able to compare across multiple retailer, but the current AdManager platform is designed to cater mostly for the retailer.",Consideration, Managed service, On-site, Reporting, Limitation, AdManager, WPP, Aggregated reporting,,,,,,,,
Mentioned that providing the ability to look across many brand instances is a direct request from the french retailer Carrefour (8th largest retailer in the world).,Carrefour, Retailers, Aggregated reporting,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Commented that if The Trade Desk (currently an off-site agency media planning similar to EllisX) get into the retail media market they will focus on cross brand/cross retailer reporting from day one.,Competitor, Off-site, Future challenge, EllisX, The Trade Desk, Aggregated reporting,,,,,,,,,,
Commented that Criteo will not be the competitor who solves the unified reporting due to the culture of the organisation; disorganisation and lack of focus; integrating with the wrong companies; not easy to change things in the current structure.,Competitor, Opportunity, Criteo,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Criteo have being talking about solving unified reporting for 8 or 9 years but have not delivered it. Although they do have good product teams, they have not being able to focus on building and delivering on this promise of delivering a self-managed unified reporting platform.",Competitor, Opportunity, Reporting, Self-serve, Criteo,,,,,,,,,,,
"Thinks the threat to AdManager will not come from Criteo, but from The Trade Desk, Mirakl, Microsoft, and similar businesses. Questioned if we need to build insights and metrics only within a dashboard, or could insights show up in different flows and experiences.",Competitor, Threat, Future challenge, AdManager, Criteo, Microsoft, Mirakl, The Trade Desk,,,,,,,,
Having key metric embedded throughout the UI and not just in dashboard would be beneficial from everyone.,Consideration, Metrics, Opportunity, UI,,,,,,,,,,,,
Idea that was suggested to Adam previously about using a tool like Content Square to get key insights on user interactions and engagement on the platform. Suggested providing insights and metrics from a UX view-point to share with retailers would be beneficial and worth doing to improve our offering. Spoke about a UX metrics embedded in the dashboard in the future (as a value-add).,Future opportunity, Metrics, UX, Value-add, Content Square, Retailers,,,,,,,,,,
"Criteo is biggest competitors, followed by PromoteIQ (owned by Microsoft). Google did roll out a beta and it wasn't successful, so they stopped the full rollout. But feels Google may try to roll out an improved version of the initial product in the future. Google integration is on the AdManager future roadmap.",Competitor, Criteo, Microsoft, PromoteIQ, Google, Threat, Future opportunity, Integrations, Roadmap,,,,,,,
"Majority of retail media business goes to Criteo or AdManager. Largest criticism of AdManager platform is the high degree of manual work required to use; it is not intuitive; it is not easy to explain, or for customers to learn.",Competitor, Business challenge, Criteo, Competitor advantage, AdManager, Difficult to use, Hard to learn, Manual effort, Guidance, Guides and support material,,,,,,
"There are no supporting guides or support on the AdManager platform, so it is hard to learn.",AdManager, Gap (Product or Service), Hard to learn, Negative feedback, Poor guidance, Guides and support material,,,,,,,,,,
"In USA, and advertising campaign can consist of 10 or 15 line items. In AdManager we have a flag campaign structure (which equates to customer line items) so it is hard for customer to visualise and manage campaigns.",Campaigns, Complexity, AdManager, Difficult to use, USA,,,,,,,,,,,
The language/terminology and structure of AdManager does not match the industry norms or mental models of our customers.,Business norm, Language use / Terminology, Mental models, AdManager, Negative feedback, Understanding vague,,,,,,,,,,
Advertiser will usually sign on with a contract (or I/O) and run a campaign 'programme' which will include lots of separate line items under the program. In the market program equates to what is known in the industry as a campaign.,Brands, Contracts, Insertion Order (IO), Campaigns, Program, Complexity, Language use / Terminology,,,,,,,,,
Currently use the wallet of the campaign names (in AdManager) to try and organise a brand or advertisers? program. In some instances CSM's may create 3 separate wallets to manage brand programs.,Business norm, Wallets, Campaigns, Program, Spend, AdManager,,,,,,,,,,
Created complex campaign naming conventions (in AdManager) as a pseudo-workaround to manage customer programs. But this is open to mis-spelling and human error.,AdManager, Managed service, Campaigns, Hack or Workaround, Complexity, Errors or Issues,,,,,,,,,,
Recommended we look at how media is being purchased by brands and advertisers.,Consideration, Recommendation, Business norm, Brands, Media buying,,,,,,,,,,,
"I think people think the objectives and goals is a huge part of setting up a campaign. But in reality, everyone's going to say that return on Ad spend is my goal. Breaking a campaign out by goal doesn't help.",Consideration, Recommendation, Campaigns, Objectives, Spend,,,,,,,,,,,
Goals are very generic. So CSM's would dig into the real wants or needs a little more to identify what they really want to get out of a campaign.,Campaigns, Objectives,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
More interested to learn how flexible the customer is around flexibility on spend and where they stand on campaigns over or under spending when optimising in-flight campaigns.,Business strategy, Campaigns, Optimisation, Spend,,,,,,,,,,,,
Setting up and signing off contracts is very complex. So want to know in advance how flexible customer are on spend to avoid having to raise additional contracts.,Contracts, Complexity, Brands,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Clarify when setting up first campaigns need to know where the customer stand on editing and optimising campaigns. Goals are helpful in reporting and presenting a 'talk track' to the customer at the end of a campaign; but not when setting up campaigns.,Business strategy, Campaigns, Objectives, Optimisation,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Very rare in the US that brands are hands on when managing campaign. Very little is self-service. As a managed service, we are making decisions on behalf of the brand. Brand will communicate changes to the Sales Rep; this in turn get communicated to the Account Manager; Account Manager will then refer to the contract; and then communicates to Campaign Optimisation Team; and then down to the Insights Team for reporting.",Business norm, Managed service, USA, Business decision, Advice and guidance, Contracts, Campaigns, Optimisation, Reporting, Brands,,,,,,
"With improvements in AdManager self-service, some brands will have expert staff to take on self-service and others will continue with a managed service model (where brands don?t have experts and just want to spend).",AdManager, Future opportunity, Self-serve, Complexity, Expertise, Brands,,,,,,,,,,
"Retailers in US will have between 4000 - 8000 brands, with usually less than 200 or 300 brands participating in online media advertising. This can translate to around 4 AdManager staff to manage.",Business norm, Campaigns, Future opportunity, Managed service, AdManager, Retailers,,,,,,,,,,
"When taking on new retailers, Customer Services will look at how many of the brands will be engaged in on-site media advertising. Typically, one AdManager staff member can manage around 40-50 brands (max) for a regular retailer. For large brands, like P&G (Procter & Gamble) with large catalogues, a AdManager staffer can manage only around 5 brands.",Business norm, Retailers, USA, Managed service, AdManager, Brands, Procter & Gamble (P&G), Staffing or resources,,,,,,,,
"Looking for ways to activate the untapped (7000) other brands who are not directly engaging in media advertising with an easy/low-touch self-managed AdManager offering. Would like better guides, definitions of metrics, setting up search terms effectively, and support material and help within the platform. Some customers find the platform too complicated (as self-service) and end up setting up their campaigns incorrectly, and then seeking help.

"We say we offer self-service, but we don't.",Expectations, Self-serve, Gap (Product or Service), AdManager,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lost a Canadian retailer (HBC fashion retailer) as they found AdManager too complicated after struggling with it for 2 years. Are now a detractor for the platform.,Complexity, Detractor, Difficult to use, Loss of revenue, AdManager,,,,,,,,,,,
"New retailers need a lot of support in setting up teams, creating campaigns and providing supporting over the on-boarding period - which can be up to 6 or 8 months.",On-boarding, Future opportunity, Business challenge, Retailers, Support,,,,,,,,,,,
AdManager need to start thinking about how brands buy media and start from this point of view instead of being so retailer-centric.,Consideration, Media buying, Business challenge, Brands, Retailers,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ahold Delhaize is the biggest retailer group on the platform and have 5 retail brands (Food Lion, FreshDirect, The Giant Company, Giant, Stop & Shop, and Hannaford - totalling over 2000 stores) and need 5 retailers, with separate banner creations for each banner, with 5 separate banner sizes and this can lead to 100 line items for each campaign in a contract.",Ahold Delhaize, Business norm, Campaigns, Complexity, Manual effort, Retailers,,,,,,,,,,
The fact that there is no notification [in the platform] is so silly.,Expectations, Gap (Product or Service), Notifications, AdManager,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Red, Yellow, Green indicator for budget pacing is not very useful.",Pacing, UI, Poor experience, Brand needs, UI improvements,,,,,,,,,,,
Brands need to be able to evenly pace campaigns in both setup and reporting/management. Mentioned Criteo have dynamic pacing based on budget spend and length of the campaign and will manage and alert on over and under spend. The amount of work and stress in manually managing budget pacing in AdManager is frustrating.,Brand needs, Campaigns, Pacing, Reporting, Brands, Competitor, Criteo, Spend, Gap (Product or Service), Competitor advantage,,,,,,

"Need better notifications in UI and on campaigns to display when campaign/SKU's are active or if they stopped serving. Brands want to know when they are delivering revenue and serving, by day - cannot see by individual SKU's (would need to go into Teams or Wallets). Needed if SKU's go out of stock or other SKU's could be out-bidding.",AdManager, Campaigns, Revenue, Wallets, SKU, Frustration, Brands, Brand needs, Notifications,,,,,,,
Brands need ability set priority SKU's within the same campaign instead of having to set up multiple campaigns with different bid amounts.Need proper day-parting. Approval at campaign and line level needed. And also improve the whole approval process (with full change log details).

"For global reporting commented to speak to Doreen Knott (SVP Sales - Unilever, Kraft, P&G, Nabisco, etc.). There are already leaders in the global reporting marketspace - for example Comscore or Winmo.

"Sharing of data across regions, for brands and reporting, would be received differently by different brands (i.e. some brands agencies will not share their data). The advantage for AdManager in agencies (of a large brand) not sharing data or speaking to each other is the ability to get each agency to spend more on their campaigns (directly with the brand and also with each agency).",Data, Reporting, Business challenge, Complexity, Data challenge, Agencies, Brands, Regional, AdManager, Opportunity, Spend, Follow-up,,,,

"Would need to be able to set up a top-level budget or campaign (program) and then provide the ability to report on the entire budget as well as each individual line item (banners, banner-x, brand pages, etc.) within the one campaign.

"The challenge for AdManager is it was originally designed to support retailer needs, but now brands are stretching that need, and scale very quickly. The way AdManager, the campaign setup currently works is too granular for most brands to self-manage. Other platforms allow brands to upload all of their products into a 'Search' campaign, and the platform would tie back all the relative search terms to those products. This avoids the need to set up each individual campaign line item.",Business challenge, Staffing or resources, Scaling, AdManager, Campaigns, Competitor, Competitor advantage, Difficult to use, Manual effort, Negative feedback, Reduce effort, UI improvements,,,,

"Crunch platform was initially used for historic metrics and reporting. But then moved to getting more useful metrics relating to customer experience and the customer funnel.

"Tenancy campaigns were originally priced in a certain way when OXO first started using the platform. Tenancy is now currently priced (for suppliers) based on a number of key metrics (e.g. click-throughs, impressions, value of product added to a basket, etc.). In 2023 all suppliers have asked for reports to evaluate all media performances. Mentioned large suppliers want to know the full (holistic) value of a campaign and not just the immediate value. OXO have done a lot of modelling for this Lifecycle Value insights (currently at around 60% of the total work needing to be done).",NOTE, Fixed Tenancy Ads, Campaigns, Suppliers, Pricing, Performance metrics, CTR, Impressions, Lifecycle value, Reporting, Need or Want, Forecasting, In-House,,,,
The main ask from suppliers in terms of future reporting has been the Lifecycle ROAS and Share. OXO want to be able to keep their own insights reporting in-synch with campaigns run on AdManager ? to maintain consistency and trust (of the data) with suppliers.,Requests, Suppliers, Future needs, Reporting, Lifecycle value, ROAS, Share of Voice, Impressions, Need or Want, Insights, Campaigns, AdManager, Trust, Data,,,
"Commented they are looking for ways to explain to suppliers why there are reporting differences in sales (actual sales versus sales recorded on AdManager), as well as the full ROAS (immediate ROAS versus the Lifecycle Value). Will also be doing some reporting metrics around the suppliers marketing funnel (similar to Amazon's brand metrics) to highlight how suppliers are performing and where they might need to invest more.",FOLLOW-UP, Suppliers, Reporting, Knowledge gap, Sales, AdManager, ROAS, Lifecycle value, Funnel, Amazon, Performance metrics,,,,,,

"To advise suppliers on campaign objective, where they might be focused on new customers (instead of conversion) so they might focus more on optimising on impressions and ROAS could be less relevant.

Difficult at present for OXO to move to Last Click reporting. Commented one supplier has done this but have experienced a number of reporting issues.,Difficulty, Last Click, Reporting, Suppliers, Issues,,,,,,,,,,,,
Christmas periods sales volumes are large and Ad slots are generally booked from August to December. Which means if you are using Last Click reporting then marketing can't get a clear idea (or take actions) for Last Click attribution reporting until all Last Click data is collected.,Season-related, Sales, Ads, Bookings, Attributions,,,,,,,,,,,,
Spend a lot of time and effort in understanding what search terms suppliers need to use on in campaigns. Search term recommendations in the platform now helps to solve a lot of the choosing search term problems.,Time and Effort, Suppliers, Advising, Search terms, Campaigns, AdManager,,,,,,,,,,,
Suggested there could be an enhancement for suggested search terms (in the platform) to also include conversion metrics along with the current impression's metric.

Suppliers (especially smaller ones) find it difficult to understand the average winning auction price. They want to know if they are winning enough Auctions. Currently OXO staff are assisting and advising suppliers on this as it can be difficult for them to get to these insights (i.e. looking at average product ranking reports).,FOLLOW-UP, Suppliers, Difficulty, Understanding unclear, Winning bids, Need or Want, Auctions, Advising, Insights,,,,,,,,
"Ad ranking is very hidden in the AdManager platform, and most suppliers don't see it as they are focused on the campaign reporting level. Suppliers would need to drill down under the campaign reporting to find this data (under search terms). Suggested most suppliers would need to be drilling down and checking Ad ranking metrics on a weekly basis. Suggested AdManager could provide even a high-level metric at a higher level within the platform ? even to provide a simple metric of where a campaign is ranking.",FOLLOW-UP, Ads, Ranking, AdManager, Challenge, Suppliers, Need or Want, Reporting, Performance metrics, Area of improvement,,,,,,,
"Only provide broad impression share metrics at this time but would like to provide more accurate view of impression shares to suppliers. For example, for 3 Tenancy booking there would be 3 featured ad slots of products taken up by tenancy. In this instance suppliers would not have any option to see if they bid on a term, but OXO still show impressions as part of the impression share. They may be getting all impressions, but they can still display as impression share in the red.",FOLLOW-UP, Impressions, Reporting, Suppliers, Opportunity, Fixed Tenancy Ads, Area of improvement,,,,,,,,,,
"Providing average Ad ranking to small suppliers would be helpful, especially as they may not want to get into the more complex metrics.",Ads, Ranking, Suppliers, Support, Opportunity,,,,,,,,,,,,
Commented on how a supplier would know if they had any missed opportunities. Impression share and Ad ranking could help to understand this. But equally if the platform suggested a number of search terms they are not bidding on and should be. In this scenario suppliers could be (a) underbidding or (b) not using search term that they should be using based on platform search recommendations. Was wondering how missed opportunities could be surfaced with metrics.,FOLLOW-UP, Suppliers, Missing opportunities, Impressions, Ads, Ranking, Bids, Recommendations, Performance metrics, Modelling,,,,,,,

"Commented that there is still no way to diagnose if suppliers are using suggested terms in Campaign manager correctly. Gave example of a report that shows OXO that a supplier received 20 suggested search terms, but only chose to go with 10 suggestions and be able report out on metrics based on their choices (e.g. conversion, sales, competitor out-bidding, etc).",Limitation, Difficulty, Search terms, Suppliers, Campaigns, Challenge,,,,,,,,,,,

"Would like to see some retailer-focused metrics in the platform as most discussions have been around catering for the needs to suppliers.

"You got it. Ok, so one of the things that we recently products was the Share-Of-Voice reporting. I will give you an example of what the final product looks like. Here. [Shared DataGrid in video chat].",DataGrid, Share of Voice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So this is essentially what we're sending to suppliers, so they can see their impression share and their click share. This particular report was for the Grocery Network just across different retailers. Just showing them where they rank in terms of impression share and click share.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But we do have these charts and all the data available in DataGrid. So it pulls in actually Hubspot data where we're look, we're able to see supplier spend and then delivery data as well so that we can capture you know, the different Ad types. So if there were keyword-only targeted placements, we'd be able to report on SOV [Share-of-Voice] for those placements versus category PDP [Product Display Pages] for, you know, let's say Target.",HubSpot, DataGrid, Placements, Share of Voice, PDP (Product Display Page), Search terms / Keywords, Spend, Brands, Ad Types, Ad serving,,,,,,
"And then more recently, we were able to sort of extract those tables [from DataGrid] and then combine them so that we can, if we filter by category label in here. Let's say for 'beverage', you'll notice that there are categories here, like anything that's 'grocery beverages', 'grocery beverages, cocoa'. These are primarily [for] Target as we have category data available. But you'll also notice that there are search terms. So if I were to search 'beverage' here, it will actually capture all search and category targeted placements and then I can just look at these charts up here. To give me an idea of how let's say the Coca Cola company performed, you know, obviously set the date range when they have media running or if you're looking at quarter over quarter. And you can see, OK, this is where Coca Cola ranked in terms of their clicks.",Categories, Placements, DataGrid, Data, Date or Time related, Filter, Manual effort, Target,,,,,,,,
"And what's really great is we do have the opportunity internally to look at sales revenue and share of Ad spend to see like, ok, well, what were they spending in comparison to other beverage suppliers during that time. So just to give you an idea of, you know, what they're spending and how their clicks and impression share are doing on a particular retailer. So it's something else that's been really useful, and this is for 'alcohol'. I just had a recent request to look at brand performance, like brand Share-Of-Voice. And looking at different alcohol brands. So we created this other data set that will allow us to filter for – it's not going to be for Grocery Network because we don't have brand tied to the product metadata yet. But it would be for like Target or Lowe's or Petco. And we can look at actual brand performance here.

"Yeah, well you would have to pull them individually. Yes. So the [future] goal would really be to be able to look at Share-Of-Voice over time, maybe like a stack bar-chart, by retailer to see, you know, for this particular brand or this particular supplier, how their share looks over time and across retailers based on their spend. So that would be sort of an ideal SOV [Share-Of-Voice] snapshot for us. But we'll get there slowly but surely. So currently you would have to filter by retailer name. In this case, I think I used a region name space to pull in like all US Grocery Network. So then the charts will update and this will just be for Grocery Network. So now we're looking at beverage across Grocery Network. You can see clicks and impression share.

So being able to look at store and online growth when we had media running versus a period of time when there was no media running. Ultimately, we would like to have Always On [spend strategy] programs. So incremental will be really important for our future. Looking at shoppers exposed versus not exposed, but we're not quite there yet. But this is just an analysis to show these are your brands that were featured in media – I think this was for Target.

"I wouldn’t ultimately sort of export the data. These charts are great because I can just screen, grab them right from DataGrid.

"In terms of the sales-left reporting that I was showing you before, looking at that organic sales data that we're receiving from the retailers. So we have a total orders value card, which we are able to – this is showing just all of the sales over time. It's actually broken out by month. In an ideal state we would like to see this broken out at a much more granular level. But we can't do that. I believe it's like 45 days. We're able to see a weekly view and then after 45 days it turns into monthly. And a lot of our campaigns run longer than 45 days. So it's just not useful for us to look at it at a weekly level there.",Retailers, Sales, Data, Date or Time related, Reporting, Limitation, Customer needs,,,,,,,,,
"But we are able to filter by retailer. So here you can filter by the retailer to sort of understand what their online sales is. What I personally like to do – because this does take into account HubSpot data as well if you go into – let me see if I can set my filters here [DataGrid ‘Share Shift’ dashboard filters], and a deal name. I'll just select one – Johnson and Johnson [in DataGrid Dealname filter selected ‘Johnson & Johnson – Listerine/Skincare Display – Shopper Q3Q4 2021’ deal name]. And this is actually pulling in product ID’s associated with this deal. So from here I will go into product name, so I can actually see the products that are associated with that with that campaign or that deal. And I'll select them. So it looks like it's just Aveeno Neutrogena [as displayed in the ProductName filter list in DataGrid]. And I'll apply it.",Products, DataGrid, Reporting, Sales, Filter, HubSpot, Johnson & Johnson (J&J), Insertion Order (IO), Neutrogena, UPC or Identifier, Campaigns,,,,,
"Yes, a deal is an IO. And then the wallets would be considered like line items. And then I would want to filter by just pull in the retailer name associated with that deal.

So I'm able to see Aveeno and Neutrogena trended organic online sales data associated with Shopper Markets.",Shopper Markets, Wallets, Neutrogena, Sales, Data, Insertion Order (IO),,,,,,,,,,
"So if I click into this now [sharing options on DataGrid report], I would really just export it. And then what's great is you can clear out these products [via the ProductName filter in DataGrid]. So now we're looking at total Shopper Markets, organic online sales data. And you can actually, in Excel, I would do the analysis but just looking at like their share [Johnson & Johnson] on within Shopper Markets. How that looked during the media live dates versus a period of time when they didn't have media running to see how their market share increased through media. But this is what I would use to get that data. And again, some campaigns will start mid-month. So the monthly breakout isn't as useful for us. It would be better if we could have like a weekly view or a daily [of the data]. This would be the view that we would look [Total Order Value in DataGrid] at to report on sales lift or share shift.

"Yeah, so from my understanding it is a limitation in DataGrid because of the way that the that we have the data available to us. Where if we have like 45 days, we can see at a more granular level. But I think it's more of a storage capacity issue – from what I've been told. So I'm not sure where that issue is happening. But, I also know in the [AdManager] UI, when you're looking at the trends, there's some limitations there as well where you can get certain views. If you look at it by day, you can see an hourly performance in the UI for your campaign. But as soon as you expand the duration for longer than a day, you're going to get just a daily view and then you will miss out on the hourly reporting.",DataGrid, AdManager, UI improvements, Date or Time related, Limitation,,,,,,,,,,,
So currently that is falling on Cathy M's [Data and Analytics manager] team. So she's a manager of BI [Business Intelligence].

"Let me see what other reports I have. So this one [Missed Opportunity playback report generated in PowerPoint] is a newer analysis that we're doing which actually shows brands the missed opportunity. So based on what your campaign delivered, this is the number of missed impressions. It's really interesting because it actually takes into consideration the Fill Rate, based on keywords or category as well as the competitors that were live in that category. So it takes into account like your impression share and the total Ads that were requested [to be served]. So it's looking at these different metrics to get a missed opportunity. And then from there we're looking at the campaign performance. So we're looking at your Click-Through rate [CTR] to get your number of missed clicks. We look at you know, CPC for missed Ad spend. And then, in the case of Target, we're able to use the enhanced Attribution dashboard [in DataGrid], which I will show you here, which allows us to look at different Attribution Windows as well as a Halo [effect]. So you can look at the brand Halo based on thing you click or the same SKU view through Halo as well. So, using that for Target gives us a nice number in terms of our missed Ad revenue.

"Well, for Target generally I use 30-day. For Lowe's, I would use 30-day as well. But in case of the Grocery Network where we only have the 14-day available, I would use that. And then the [DataGrid] dashboard for the missed opportunity is going to be… or the card, I should say it's not on your dashboard yet. So for Search, this is what it looks like where you're actually looking at the generic search terms [showed Search Terms in DataGrid against Impressions, Missed Opportunities, CTR, Missed Clicks, Missed Conversion rates and Missed Ad spend] associated with the campaign. You can look at showing you the number of impressions and then the number of missed impressions as well as performance for those different terms.

"So in this case, what I would do is clear this out, find the ID [entered Target and Deal ID in the filters in DataGrid]. So I'm able to again pull in the HubSpot data as well as the delivery data and then the Fill Rate, [and] dashboard as well data set. So for this particular campaign and what I'm looking at here. So it's for Duracell [selected the Dealname filter in DataGrid ‘Duracell – Target Product Ads – Alpha Test – Q2’]. Obviously, these were all the battery related search terms. And you can see here, based on the impressions that were delivered for each of those terms. And then looking at the Ads requested, minus those impressions, you can see that we have a missed opportunity. Then taking into account the actual, the rate.",Missed opportunity, Target, Ad requests, Ad serving, Impressions, Business norm, HubSpot, DataGrid, Filter,,,,,,,

I can hear you now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So it's the capped number of Ads requested. So, it's not just the number of Ads requested because sometimes that number can be inflated. So we have to cap it by what's actually available. So that's why we use the capped number of Ads requested minus the total impressions that were just the total impressions overall times. The impression Share-Of-Voice for that particular deal ID. So this an analysis that we can use at the deal level, not at the wallet. Because at the wallet [level] there could be duplication of different wallets containing specific keywords which would then increase or inflate our missed opportunity.",Business challenge, Ad requests, Impressions, Insertion Order (IO), Metrics, Share of Voice, Wallets, Missed opportunity,,,,,,,,
"So here we were looking at the total number of Ads requested minus the total impressions associated with those keywords. And then the missed opportunity takes into account the Share-Of-Voice for this deal in particular. And then from there, we're leveraging the campaign – the click-through rate [CTR] associated with those keywords to get the number of missed clicks, and the conversion rate to get the missed Ad spend. And then it's sort of a manual pull [effort] right now to leverage that enhanced attribution dashboard data to determine a missed Ad revenue.",Manual effort, CTR (Click Thru Rate), Conversion Rate, Missed opportunity, Impressions, Ad requests, Share of Voice, Revenue,,,,,,,,
"So this is just an example [showed a Topline Performance playback deck in PowerPoint] of our attributable sales. So we just recently received store data for Wakefern. And I wanted to give them a view in terms of the point-of-sale revenue – where those sales are occurring for those [categories] of which are attributable to the media. So here, we just have overall delivery. It's really interesting too because just bringing in [the] store we could see our ROAS increase by a dollar 45 [cents] and it went up to 195 [$1.95]. But obviously online is a shorter path to purchase. And even though there's likely more sales happening in store, those that we're attributing are based on click only. So the shopper has to show some form of intent before we're actually attributing that sale to someone viewing it online first. In this case, it was a P&G [Procter & Gamble] example that I used here. And they had their wallets broken out by category for them [i.e. OralCare, ShaveCare, FemCare, HairCare, etc]. So it was manual, but I was able to get to category-level performance. And this is again for Wakefern. So we don't have category data available for the products at this time or brands. But just looking at ROAS and how it for the different wallets and how it correlates with a total conversion rate overall.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This is one of the first for network, which is exciting. And we have a few others that were in progress in getting their store data as well. So definitely exciting. Plus it's great because it's just going to help our performance overall, being able to tell that [spend and performance] story. This is the dashboard for Wakefern [showed DataGrid dashboard] where we're able to look at [Ad] delivery data as well as store and online breakouts. And then obviously it's available by month, and then by wallet, you can look at it by product. Another analysis that I'm going to include with this is going to be like top online sales products and then top store sales by product. So they can see how that differs… online versus store for those featured products within their media. So that's another example. But ultimately, I think the goal for us would be to [do] something that's really missing in our reporting for network currently would be the ability to report on brand and category for those retailers.",Sales, In-store, Performance, On-site, Categories, Gap (Product or Servcie), Reporting, Retailers,,,,,,,,
"It's just I think it's the product metadata that we need to find like a common… like using the UPC [Universal Product Code], which is common across all retailers.

Because I believe that the UPC pack should contain all that, all those elements.",Categories, Customer needs, Future opportunity, Brands, UPC or Identifier,,,,,,,,,,,
"Right? So some retailers we have it available. So for Share-Of-Voice, let's say for Grocery Network, I'm able to sort of look at a beverage category. I can create a category by using generic search terms [e.g. beverage]. Let me just show you here. So here's a generic search term. I want to report on the beverage category. So I want to see all suppliers that are bidding on beverage, right? And then I can look here and say OK, for the keyword placements, these are the top suppliers that are bidding on beverage. So that's essentially our beverage category. But it would be nice to have the categories broken out in this. Let me see, it's not going to show here because I'm looking at [Grocery] Network. To be able to see like, this is ‘grocery > beverage’, ‘grocery >  beverages > flavoured drinks’, ‘grocery beverages > soda’, and ‘grocery > beverages > water’ [from the filter options displayed in DataGrid].

"Here is an example of like a standard final metrics report I'll show you [displayed a Brand Level Performance PowerPoint deck for Snacks]. This particular one was for Pepsi [showed a Campaign Overview report PowerPoint deck]. So, you know, they had multiple brands featured. But if you go into the [AdManager] UI, it's just all the brands, and all the products associated with those brands are combined. So it's hard when there are different leads [account managers] for each of the brands who you have to report to. So they ask in their final reporting that we break out the brand performance overall. So you'll see, like now we have to report Bubly. And so we have Bubly performance, and then Bubly keyword performance, and then Bubly SKU level performance and then the campaign level. So for Bubly, we had two different keyword line items [one line item had $15,458 spend and the second had $4,379 spend]. And then we have sales earnings for Bubly only, and then key insights. And then we go into Pepsi, which is the next brand that we have to report on. So it ends up being a lot of data pulls for us [from DataGrid] and then aggregating it into these charts in Excel. Whereas if we could just have the ability to look at brand-level performance in the [AdManager] UI, it would just make things a lot easier. So the [campaign performance] report ends up being like 120 slides or something because they have so many brands.",PowerPoint, Limitation, SKU, Reporting, Data, Managed service, DataGrid, Brands, AdManager, Metrics, Excel, Performance, Bubly, Manual effort,,

Ok. We'll wait for her to join.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"I think so. They want insights, they want to know what's performing and what's not. And the way that our [Ad] Op’s team sets things up and optimises – looking at keywords that are performing better – they'll group them into one wallet and then have sort of those mid-tier keywords in another wallet. So there are different line items. Obviously, we know we want to allocate more spend to those higher performing terms, right? So just sort of looking at that strategy overall, post campaign, is important to them to understand what's driving performance. And then they want to have exposure too for some of the more broader [search] terms that maybe they're not going to see as much conversion associated with them. But you want to still be present within the category. So you have to bid on those two.

"Pacing [reporting] is primarily the [Ad] Op’s team. But if there was an incident where we weren't pacing, and it was impacting our ability to scale or even impacting our ability to spend the budget. It's something that we will mention post campaign. So a lot of times before we're sending off these reports to the brands or to the sales leads, we will consult with the Op’s team and just to find out what happened.

"So I think the point that I was just trying to make was that it would be nice to have categories available. Currently, I can create a category when they're not just by looking at relevant terms. Like if I were to look at beverage, like I am here and select ‘US’ – to be our Grocery Network. We're essentially looking at all suppliers who are targeting beverage keyword terms. So that's really like what I would consider a beverage category. So, I can do that here in this level, in this type of reporting. But, really when we're trying to break out performance overall, I think it would be just useful to have the categories available [in the AdManager UI].",Future opportunity, AdManager, Customer needs, Grocery Network / Grocery One, Relevancy, Aggregated reporting, Managed service, Categories,,,,,,,,
"So recently I got a request for Target to provide category-level benchmarks. And we can do that with Target because we have categories available, associated with their products. But if Grocer One wanted to see category benchmarks, it would be a lot more difficult because I don't have product ID’s associated with specific categories, if that makes sense.

"I'm trying to think if there's anything else that would be helpful for you guys to see. So this is something that Cathy's [M] currently working on [showed a Forecast Revise dashboard in DataGrid]. So actually Ellen on my team and Cathy worked on this. This is a forecasting tool to help the sellers understand exactly how much they can spend on certain keywords. So, we're looking at a rolling 30-day average. This dashboard is great because it actually brings in data from our Fill Rate data set, which is managed by the [Ad] Op’s team. And it looks at average spots filled, average spots unfilled. So you have all of that data. Capped number of Ads requested. But then it also looks at the competing suppliers as well as [Ad] delivery data. So you can see that there's like CPC here, then the Max CPC associated with those keywords. And then you see the delivery data impressions and CTR here.",Fill Rate, Managed service, Future opportunity, Competitor, Reporting, Ad requests, CPC (Cost Per Click), CTR (Click Thru Rate),,,,,,,,
"So what we're able to do was when forecasting is we created aggressive CPC spend. So if you're running a campaign for beverages... But essentially what you can do is take the number of months that are going to be in your, in your flight, or in your campaign. And you will multiply that [by] times, either the holiday or non-holiday timing, depending on whether or not you want to be [spend] aggressive or you just want to be middle of the pack, in your bids. So then they can estimate to see Ok, this is how much I would need to spend based on all of the relevant keyword terms that I'm looking to target for my campaign.

"Yes, exactly. Because what we're doing is you don't have to toggle between dates. So if you're trying to plan a campaign next year for six months, you there's no toggling here. We wanted to show the actual view of the business today. So based on the number of competitors that are currently bidding on those keywords. And, based on just what's happening more recently. That's the view that we wanted to give. So that's why we're looking at a rolling 30-days.

"And the other report which I think is going to be really useful if I can find it. Let me see here. So this is a new one that's going to be very important [showed a Cap Out report dashboard in DataGrid].  So this report is the Cap Out report. It's going to show essentially… you're able to look at your deal. So your campaign. I'm sorry, you're actually going to have to look at wallet here. And you'll select your wallet name and it's going to show you by day when the campaign is capping out. So that you'll know if you don't have enough spend per day.

And from there you can see, Ok, here we were capping out the 16th hour here around noon, right?
